    "Name":"Pizza",
    "Description":"<p>The story of the invention of this everyday household name changes depending on how you define it. If you think a pizza is an oven-baked flatbread, its origins lie in the ancient Middle East. If pizza must have toppings, its origins date back to the ancient Romans and Greeks, who baked flatbreads and topped them with available, local spices and olive oil. But the pizza we all know today, made with tomato sauce, cheese, and numerous toppings, originated in Italy. It became popular in Naples in the 18th century as a cheap, nourishing food that was consumed mainly by peasants. The modern pizza as we know it today evolved from early Neapolitan flatbreads topped with lard, salt, and garlic. No one knows when or why the tomato first began being used in the preparation of pizza, but it is known that they were first recorded in Italy in 1544. While most Europeans initially disparaged them as poisonous, the southern Italians embraced them, giving them the name pomi d&rsquo;oro (golden apples). Although some say that tomatoes have been used on pizza marinara since 1734, others claim that they were not used until the early 19th century. The Italians credit Raffaele Esposito of Pizzeria Brandi as having invented the first modern pizza in 1889. He was supposed to make a variety of pizzas for the queen, so he made one with lard, cheese, and basil, one with fish, and one with mozzarella, basil, and tomatoes. Known as pizza alla mozzarella at the time, this last pizza later became known as pizza margherita, once the queen declared it as her favorite. Interestingly enough, the colors of the margherita are the same as those found on the Italian flag. Pizza crossed over the Italian border shortly thereafter, to Spain, France, England, and the United States, where it was introduced by Italian immigrants. However, it didn&rsquo;t gain much popularity until after World War II. In the United States, the first pizzeria was opened in New York City by Gennaro Lombardi in 1905, and since then it has become one of the most popular food items in the United States. In an ironic twist of fate, American-style pizza has been re-exported back to Italy, where it is has also gained in popularity today. In 2008, two Italian associations called Real Pizza and the Association of Neapolitan Pizza-makers introduced new regulations on what constitutes a true Neapolitan pizza. According to them, the real, legally-protected Neapolitan margherita should be made with exact amounts of mozzarella, salt, and tomatoes, and it should be baked in a wood-fired oven at 485&deg;C. Today, there are numerous variations of this beloved dish throughout the world, from those with simple toppings such as ham, prosciutto, onions, and bell peppers, to unusual variations such as hot dog or hamburger pizza or decadent toppings such as white truffles, edible gold, lobster, and caviar.</p>",

    "Name":"Sushi",
    "Description":"<p>Sushi is Japan's most famous culinary representative, typically made with rice and fillings which have been rolled inside a a sheet of dry seaweed. However, the term <em>sushi</em> is actually an umbrella term covering a wide range of subvarieties which can be made with a myriad of different ingredients and in as many forms and presentations. Although the dish has become wrongly synonymous with raw fish, the primary ingredient of every type of sushi is only vinegared rice. Originally, sushi was only a method of preserving fish - first developed in Southeast Asia, but it reached Japan in the 8th century. Over time, the dish slowly transformed. Rice was no longer fermented but vinegared and eaten together with fish, and by the 19th century, sushi as we know it today was invented. Besides rice, which can be white or brown, other ingredients include seafood, meat, and vegetables that can be either raw or cooked. Termed as the original type of sushi, <em>nigirizushi </em>is prepared by draping a mound of rice with a sliced topping, frequently with some wasabi in between or on the side, while probably the most popular type of sushi known worldwide is <em>makizushi</em>; small, usually bite-sized cylindrical pieces most commonly wrapped in <em>nori</em> &mdash; a sheet of dry seaweed. Other best-known types of sushi include <em>chirashizushi</em>, served as a bowl of rice topped with a selection of raw ingredients; the pressed variety called <em>oshizushi</em>; <em>inarizushi </em>- deep-fried tofu sacs containing a filling; the traditional <em>narezushi</em> made with fermented rice; and <em>temaki</em>, cone-shaped pieces of seaweed filled with ingredients. Sushi can be eaten with chopsticks or fingers, and it is typically served on a platter or in a bento box with a compartment for dips (usually soy sauce). Due to the worldwide popularity of sushi, many variations of the dish developed outside of Japan.</p>",

    "Name":"Burger",
    "Description":"<p>A quintessential American food, burger evolved from the German <em>Deutsches beefsteak</em>, according to the <em>New York Times</em> food critic Mimi Sheraton. Its other name (<em>hamburger</em>) is a result of the fact that many German immigrants originally came from the port of Hamburg. Burger is a succulent dish consisting of, ideally, medium-rare seared beef patties tucked in fresh, lightly toasted buns, accompanied by onion slices and ketchup or Dijon mustard. Of course, there is a variety of other condiments and vegetables such as salad greens and tomatoes, but they tend to turn the meat cold, according to Mrs. Sheraton. If cheese is added, it should be mozzarella, Gruyere or Cheddar, slightly melting and mildly pungent. It is yet unclear who first thought to encase the beef patties with buns. Giovanni Ballarini, a food historian, says that the immigrants were given grilled meat between sliced of bread, so there would be no plates involved, and no water was wasted for washing the dishes. Hannah Glasse first mentioned a Hamburg \"<em>sausage</em>\" in her 1747 cookbook <em>The Art of Cookery, Made Plain and Easy</em>, defining it as a chopped mixture of beef and spices that should be served with toast. Or maybe it was Charlie Nagreen, a meatball seller from Wisconsin, who, in 1885, decided to put meatballs between bread so the consumers could eat them while walking at a country fair where he worked. Today, toppings and accompaniments vary from region to region, but for an original version one should visit <em>Louis' Lunch</em> in New Haven, Connecticut, serving the burgers since 1900, and claiming to be the oldest burger joint in the United States. Whatever the theories about the origin of burgers may be, and there are a lot of them, it is a convenient, simple and hearty meal that most meat lovers will gladly indulge in.</p>",

    "Name":"Ramen",
    "Description":"<p>Ramen is a noodle soup that first appeared in Japan in 1910, when Chinese cooks combined the noodles with a salty broth. These curly noodles were of bright yellow color and more elastic than the Japanese noodles prepared at the time &ndash; the dough was kneaded with a sodium carbonate-infused mineral water called <em>kansui</em>. In 1958, its name was derived from the pronunciation of the Chinese word <em>lamian</em> (pulled noodles), and that same year, <em>Nissin Foods</em> produced the first-ever instant version of noodles with a chicken-flavored broth called <em>Chickin Ramen</em>. Shortly after, the dish started to be exported around the world. Ramen should be cooked <em>al dente</em> and eaten quickly while it is still hot. It is not recommended to leave the noodles sitting in the broth for too long, as they tend to become too soft and mushy. The dish can be either <em>kotteri </em>(rich) or <em>assari/paitan</em> (light), depending on the opaqueness and the heaviness of the broth which is usually made using animal bones or dried seafood mixed with onions, garlic, ginger, leeks, and mushrooms. Two most famous types of ramen are <em>ramen of Kyushu,</em> prepared with a boiled pork bone broth called <em>tonkotsu</em>, and <em>ramen of Hokkaido, </em>made with a traditional seasoning called <em>red miso</em>.</p>",

    "Name":"Tacos",
    "Description":"<p>Tacos are the national dish of Mexico, dating back to the Mexican silver mines of the 18th century, when the word <em>taco</em> referred to gunpowder that was wrapped in a piece of paper and inserted into rocks. It was used to excavate the precious ore from mines and was called <em>tacos de minero</em> or <em>miner's tacos.</em> Today, the word is widely known to signify the leading street food and fast food item in Mexico &ndash; thin, flat griddle-baked tortillas topped with numerous fillings, folded and eaten without any utensils. A taco is basically anything eaten on a soft tortilla, and there is an infinite variety of them. In Sonora, in the north of Mexico, they eat the classic <em>carne asada</em> - thinly sliced meat grilled over coals and topped with salsa, onions, guacamole, and a lime wedge. In Baja, the topping consists of fried fish with cabbage and an acidic mayonnaise sauce. In Mexico City, <em>sudados</em> (sweated tacos) are the most popular option, filled with cooked and steamed meat. In Jalisco and Michoacan, they prepare <em>carnitas</em>, eaten in the morning or in the early afternoon, filled with deep fried pieces of pork that are sliced according to preference. Similar is the <em>taco de cabeza</em>, filled with pieces of cow's head that was steamed for a long time, and the customers can choose from slices of eyes, brains, tongue, lips, cheek, or ears. Tacos are mainly made of corn, except in the north, where wheat flour is used more often. They also differ in size, from the tiniest white tacos (<em>blancas</em>) to bigger ones, often made with blue corn. Most tacos come in pairs of two, in order to be able to hold all the flavorful and slightly wet ingredients. Some of them are fried until they become crispy and crunchy, in which case they're called <em>tostadas</em>. As anything can be a filling, there is a version made with fried veins from dried chiles, usually accompanied by salt, a tasty treat called <em>tacos de venas</em>. However, the standard is ground or shredded meat, cheese, potatoes, or vegetables and a topping of onions and coriander. Eaten at all times of day and night, one can find them on every corner in Mexico, in restaurants known as <em>taquerias.</em> Alternatively, they can be bought from numerous street vendors.</p>",

Over the years, cupcakes have become a huge industry, and the name cupcake is now given to any small cake that is about the size of a cup.

Later it is rolled and shaped into small circular forms. Although its origins might be in China, mochi has been associated with Japan for centuries. It initially appeared during the Yayoi period, when it was only enjoyed by the aristocracy, up until the Heian period, when it became a food that was commonly prepared and served during religious festivities, as people believed it brings fortune and health. Mochi can be incorporated in savory dishes, usually soups and snacks, but most commonly it is made into a confectionery item. In its dessert form, mochi is usually dressed up with food coloring, creating a myriad of delightful color combinations. The most common confectionery is referred to as <em>daifuku </em>- round cakes filled with different ingredients such as the traditional red bean paste, strawberries, or ice cream.

    "Name":"Tortilla",
    "Description":"<p>Tortilla, originally a corn flatbread, is one of the essential bread varieties that has been present in Mexican culture for thousands of years. The first tortilla was created out of the staple ingredient of indigenous cultures, the ubiquitous corn. It was an ingredient used by the ancient Mesoamerican people, who would store the corn kernels and later process them to create <em>masa</em>, which was then formed into balls and hand pressed to create the familiar, round and thin tortilla. This ancient tradition is still present among some native Indian groups, who are excessively trained to perfect the art of making authentic tortillas. The narrative of the tortilla has been inadvertently changed after the arrival of Spanish conquistadors to the area in the 15th century. The conquistadors brought their different culinary traditions, in which wheat played a crucial role, while the authentic corn was regarded as food of the plebeians. However, the tradition of growing and cooking with corn remained popular in rural areas among the indigenous Indians. The emergence of the wheat tortilla is believed to have happened during the colonial time, but what caused its appearance is not quite clear. Some theories claim that it grew out of the European tradition, some that it was an intentional invention of Indians to please the palates of European conquistadors, and some even say that the exiled Spanish Jews created it since they believed corn was not kosher. Regardless of the reason, wheat tortilla has first spread around the area of the Rio Grande River and continued to gain popularity following the agricultural production and advancement. Today, tortillas are not only a Mexican favorite: due to proximity, historical influence, and large Hispanic influx, tortillas have stopped being regarded as an ethnic bread in the United States, and have thoroughly been immersed as a part of the American culinary heritage. Today, tortillas are usually used as a foundation and a wrapper to numerous dishes such as <em>tacos</em>, <em>burritos</em>, <em>enchiladas,</em> and <em>quesadillas</em>. They are also commonly served alongside stews and chilies, where they are often used as an accompaniment and a utensil used to scoop the dish. Whether made with corn or wheat, this ancient Mexican product has gained followers around the world and has become one of the most common bread varieties in the world.</p>",

The term <em>dim sum</em> translates to<em> touch the heart</em>, and according to legend, it was invented many centuries ago by cooks of the Royal Court in order to touch the heart of Chinese emperors (but not to fully satiate their hunger). What started as a simple snack is now a key part of Chinese culture. It is also a ritual family dish eaten on most weekend mornings in Hong Kong. Each dish usually consists of a few pieces of dim sum varieties, served in steamer baskets or on small plates, making them great for sharing or trying out new flavors. Whether it is steamed dumplings with pork and prawns, spring rolls, stuffed crab claws, rice porridge congee, pork buns, <em>wo tip</em> dumplings with ground meat or rice noodle rolls, a variety of dim sum will satisfy even the most demanding consumers.</p>",

Some claim that Bertha Palmer, wife of the owner of <em>Palmer House Hotel</em>, asked the chef to invent a new chocolate dessert to serve at the 1893 Colombian Exposition. Others say that it was an accident, when Brownie Schrumpf, a librarian, excluded baking powder from a chocolate cake and was left with a thick, black cake bar. Regardless of the origins, what really popularized the brownies were instant, boxed mixes from the 1950s made by two brands - <em>Duncan Hines</em> and <em>Betty Crocker</em>. Of course, the best brownies are not the ones from a box. Some prefer them underbaked, moist, and fudgy on the interior, while some like them well-baked until they develop a spongy texture. The chocolate used for brownies must be of high quality, dark and bittersweet. Nowadays, there is a number of brownie varieties with added walnuts, pecans, chocolate chips, or even chili powder. Portable, easy to prepare and satisfying, brownies are said to taste the best when paired with a glass of cold milk.</p>",

Although American cheese was the original choice, Swiss, Cheddar, and numerous blue cheeses were all used later to make this mouth-watering sandwich. As with most dishes that are extremely popular, the history of the cheeseburger is somewhat complicated. Adding cheese to hamburgers didn't become popular until the mid-1920s, and there are numerous claims as to who invented the first cheeseburger. The most popular theory by far says that it was invented by a 16-year-old short-order cook named Lionel Clark Sternberger at a restaurant called <em>The Rite Spot</em> in Pasadena, California, when he added a slice of American cheese to a sizzling meat patty. Other places also claimed that they invented the cheeseburger, such as <em>Kaelin's Restaurant</em> from Louisville, Kentucky, saying they first made it in 1934. However, the trademark for the name was given to Louis Ballast of the <em>Humpty Dumpty Drive-In</em> in Denver, Colorado in 1935. Today, there are numerous variations on the classic cheeseburger, so it may contain more than one slice of cheese or more than one patty, while the toppings range from bacon, eggs, and ham to chili peppers, mushroom, onions, and guacamole.</p>",

Although it is an American staple, the dish was probably inspired by various pasta and cheese dishes that were enjoyed in Italy, France, and the United Kingdom, before its appearance in the United States. It was Thomas Jefferson who eventually popularized it, when he had the pasta machine shipped back home to Virginia and served the dish at his lavish banquets, while in 1824, his distant cousin Mary Randolph published the first mac and cheese recipe. The dish was further popularized in 1937, when the American company <em>Kraft</em> placed the boxed variety on the market. It was cheap and easy to prepare, but also a meal that could feed the whole family. Nowadays, mac and cheese is the ultimate comfort food dish in the United States, and in 2007, it was proclaimed the fourth most iconic American food in a survey conducted by <em>James Beard Foundation</em>.</p>",

Wagashi is characterized by its design, so in spring, when cherry blossom is in full bloom, the producers make wagashi in cherry blossom shapes, using cherry petals or leaves. The origins of these sweets date back to the Yayoi Era when there was nothing more than natural nuts, fruits, and berries, so wagashi was influenced by the grain processing skills introduced from China. Most of the basic forms of wagashi seen today are derived from that era. The introduction of sugar helped in further development of wagashi, and during the early Edo Period, the sweets developed into numerous varieties and started to be used at tea ceremonies, given as gifts, or consumed as afternoon snacks. After that, wagashi was perfected into the style that we know and love today.</p>",

Today, the centuries-old technique of smoking whole hogs over a pit is now common in both Virginia and North Carolina. Barbecue was originally found mostly in rural areas, but in recent years it has moved to bigger cities, and how could it not with the aromatic and fragrant appeal of tender, juicy meats, elevating the mouth-watering bites to cult status. Varieties of barbecue are greatly linked to geography with styles varying wildly from North to South and East to West. In Eastern North Carolina, the hog is slowly cooked over coals and doused for hours in a spicy sauce of red pepper flakes and vinegar while being chopped or 'pulled' throughout the process. Pulled pork meat is then stuffed into tender white buns and topped with fresh, mayonnaise-flavored coleslaw. In Western North Carolina, Lexington-style barbecue is king with slowly cooked pork shoulders heavily seasoned with pepper, vinegar, and ketchup sauce. Texas barbecue replaces pork with tender beef briskets cooked in pits, while Kentuckians like to slowly cook mutton in Worcesteshire sauce. Louisiana barbecue differs from all the rest, as the pulled meat served in a soft bun with slaw comes from a suckling pig. Similarly, in South Carolina, pulled pork is drizzled with a mustard and vinegar sauce, while in Kansas the barbecue pork is served on bread with a sauce based on tomatoes and molasses. Traveling to Memphis, one can find barbecued pork ribs with a flavorful, spicy crust achieved by a special dry-rub seasoning. More than just a cooking technique, barbecue is a subculture of its own with rivalry between neighboring states and contests for titles at numerous competitions throughout the South.</p>",

Depending on the cut of chicken and the method of preparation, there are various types of this dish. An important step in the making of yakitori is the seasoning, either salty or salty-sweet, which can be done during or after grilling. Salty seasoning is just salt that can sometimes be combined with pepper, while salty-sweet seasoning is actually <em>tare</em> sauce made from <em>mirin</em>, soy sauce, sake, and sugar. Present-day versions of yakitori first appeared during the Meiji Era in the 19th century, but once chicken became abundantly available in the 1950s, the popularity of skewered chicken skyrocketed and the dish became popular among the masses. In Japan, yakitori can be purchased in specialized yakitori shops called <em>yakitori-ya</em>, but it is also often served in Japanese gastropubs known as <em>izakaya</em>. Since skewered chicken is so easy to prepare, plus it's portable, it is also a popular street food sold at <em>yatai</em>, the small Japanese food stalls. The dish is meant to be eaten with hands only, often directly off the skewer, and can be paired with a side of roasted vegetables, while each bite should ideally be washed down with ice-cold beer.</p>",

The first written mention, dating from 1885, was somewhat different, and the word was used to refer to a whiskey drink, similar to <em>eggnog</em>, which was used as a health remedy. At the end of the 19th century, milkshakes were already prepared as milk-based drinks made with flavored syrups. The invention of malted milk powders which contained dried milk, malted barley, and wheat flour, along with the popularization of electric blenders, inspired the creation of a more familiar milkshake version. These inventions transformed the old-fashion milkshake into a creamy and airy form that we are more familiar with today. The final contribution to the modern milkshake was made by Ivar &ldquo;Pop&rdquo; Coulson, an employee at the <em>Walgreens</em> supermarket, who added scoops of vanilla ice-cream to the already famous malted drink. The creamy, cold drink became an instant hit among the Americans, especially teenagers, who would regularly enjoy their milkshakes in diners and fast-food restaurants. The soda fountains equipped with different flavored milkshakes were also put in drugstores as a quick and convenient refreshment. Although not as popular as they were in the 1950s and the 1960s, they are still a crucial part of American culture, reminiscent of youth and enjoyment. This frothy, refreshing beverage is also favored in Australia and the United Kingdom, where it is usually sold in fast-food restaurants and specialized establishments. Modern-day milkshakes, on the other hand, include some unusual varieties such as mango or mocha, and might include luxury ingredients or even be spiked with alcohol.

Macarons, which first appeared in Italy in 1533 (albeit without the filling), got their name from the Italian word <em>maccherone</em>, which means <em>fine dough</em>. They were originally made for the marriage of the Duke of Orl&eacute;ans, who later became King Henry II of France. Food historians credit Pierre Desfontaines as the inventor of the macaron. He was the first to fill the cookies with a creamy ganache and stick them together, turning the humble almond cookie into the versatile treat we know today. Macarons are the most popular type of cookie in Paris, but they are popular throughout the rest of the world as well, and they appear with different fillings and in various sizes, colors, and flavors.</p>",

    "Description":"<p>Although many people get a chill through their spine at the very mention of the word <em>pickles</em>, Koreans have found a way to make fermented pickled vegetables interesting, tasty and titillating. A classic starter or a side dish to any Korean meal, these spicy, salty, sweet and sour vegetables known as kimchi start their way sliced, tied in bundles, and marinated in brine with hot chili peppers, salty fish paste, leeks, ginger, sugar, and garlic. Although the popularity of kimchi is still rising in the West, it is an ancient dish, dating about two thousand years back, when it was first mentioned in written documents. It was originally called <em>chimchae</em>, literally translated to <em>soaked vegetables</em>, because kimchi was soaked only in brine or beef stock in the past, but by the 12th century, other ingredients and seasonings began to be added to the pot. Nowadays, kimchi is made both in North and South Korea, the Southern version being more salty and spicy than the Northern one. Seasons also play a role in the flavors of kimchi - refreshing cucumber kimchi is popular in spring and summer, while winter kimchis may contain radish and mustard leaves. Due to its sharp and pungent odor, it is traditionally fermented outdoors, buried in barrels or crock pots. Even though it is served as an appetizer, it usually stays on the table during the whole meal, accompanying classics such as <em>bulgogi</em>, <em>kalbi</em>, and <em>mandu guk</em> (dumpling soup), while cabbage kimchi is often fried into kimchijeon pancakes and incorporated into numerous soups and stews. A staple of any Korean meal, the dish is so beloved that the locals even shout \"kimchi!\" when their picture is taken, in the same manner that Americans shout \"cheese!\".</p>",

In the past, doughnuts were known as <em>olykoeks</em> (oily cakes), and the pilgrims from Holland are credited for bringing them to the United States. Those early doughnuts were often made with prunes, raisins, or apples in the middle. During World War I, the doughnut was already an American favorite, consumed by soldiers that were fighting overseas as a reminder of home. In the 1950s and the 1960s, the popularity of these treats was so big that new doughnut chains started appearing on the market, such as <em>Krispy Kreme</em> and <em>Dunkin' Donuts</em>, helping in the perception of doughnuts as breakfast food. Today, there are numerous varieties of doughnuts - glazed, powdered, filled, topped with frosting, coconut, peanuts, or sprinkles, and every year on the first Friday of June people celebrate the National Doughnut Day. This event was initially created by the Salvation Army in 1917 as a way to support the morale of the American troops during World War I and was later re-established in 1938, in honor of those who served the soldiers with fresh doughnuts during World War I.</p>",

    "Name":"Tiramis??",
    "Description":"<p>Even though tiramis&ugrave; is actually a fairly recent invention, this dessert of coffee-soaked ladyfingers layered with mascarpone cream enjoys an iconic status among Italian desserts. Its name stems from the phrase <em>tirami s&ugrave;</em>, an Italian expression which literally means <em>pick me up</em>, a reference to the uplifting effects of sugar, liquor, and coffee. The origins of tiramis&ugrave; are heavily disputed between Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia regions, but it is often suggested that the first was made in Veneto in the early 1980s. In fact, the earliest documented recipe for tiramis&ugrave; (interestingly, without alcohol!) was printed in the 1981 spring edition of <em>Vin Veneto</em> magazine in an article on coffee-based desserts by Giuseppe Maffioli, a renowned food critic and member of the Italian Academy of Cuisine. However, in August 2017, Friuli-Venezia Giulia's tiramisu was officially added to the list of traditional regional dishes, but a Veneto local won the Tiramisu World Cup in November 2017, so the playing field is somewhat levelled once again. Regardless of these disputes, the perfect tiramis&ugrave; should always deliver a serious caffeine kick from a shot of strong espresso, while brandy-fortified Marsala wine adds a nice sweet buzz.</p>",

    "Name":"Fudge",
    "Description":"<p>Fudge is a creamy American confectionery made with milk, sugar, butter, and various toppings and flavorings. It is created by boiling milk, butter, and sugar to a degree of 240 &deg;F/116 &deg;C, and then beating it while it cools down, creating creamy but firm blocks which are later cut into delicate individual pieces. In the United States, modern producers replaced the milk with cream, creating an even smoother and sweeter product. Although fudge is probably an original American invention, it is thought that predecessors to fudge were French classics such as <em>fondant</em> and <em>caramel</em>. Numerous theories claim that fudge was an accidental product, invented when an unintentional mistake occurred while creating the famous French caramel candy. The first written mention of fudge goes back to 1921, when Evelyn B. Hartridge, a student at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, wrote to her professor claiming that the first reference to fudge goes back to 1886. She writes that it was invented in Baltimore by her acquaintance, and was sold for 40 cents per pound. Hartridge later started producing and selling it, making it an extremely popular product, first at numerous universities, and then everywhere in the country. The popularity of fudge led to the opening of numerous shops specialized in the production of many fudge varieties. The first shops appeared on the Mackinac Island in Michigan, which is still considered to be the American fudge capital. Despite modern techniques, this creamy American product is still predominately bought from specialized stores, and freshly prepared it represents a luscious treat, enjoyed by people of all ages. The most popular fudge flavor is undoubtedly chocolate, followed by traditional plain vanilla. Other popular versions include varieties created with pecan nuts, peanut butter, marshmallows, cookies, or mint. Americans prefer to consume them during the Christmas holidays and the summer season, when they are usually bought and carried home as souvenirs and gifts. This authentic American product is also popular in the United Kingdom, where the fudge-specialized shops also exist and produce their traditional varieties. <em>Hot fudge</em>, the heated and more liquid type, is often used as a topping for ice creams and sundaes across the United States and Canada.</p>",

They consist of a thin wrapper made with wheat flour, eggs, and water, which is then stuffed with a mixture of meat and vegetables. The ingredients used in the stuffing are regionally influenced, but most commonly include minced pork or chicken, cabbage, chives, a substantial amount of garlic, ginger, and green onions. They are traditionally prepared in three different ways. The most famous are <em>pan-fried gyoza</em>, which are fried and then shortly steamed. Other types include <em>boiled gyoza</em>, usually served in broth, and the less common <em>deep-fried</em> variety. Traditionally, these scrumptious dumplings are served with a dipping sauce on the side, usually made with rice vinegar, soy sauce, and sesame oil. Since the 1940s, gyoza have been slowly making their progress to become one of the staple foods in Japan, commonly consumed everywhere in the country. They can be found on the menus of traditional Japanese restaurants and bought at specialized gyoza shops. In restaurants, they are usually offered as a starter, as a part of dim sum, or as a side dish to main meals, but gyoza are most commonly enjoyed as a snack, followed by a glass of cold beer or traditional sake.</p>",

    "Description":"<p>Often referred to as the <em>Chinese ravioli</em>, wontons are a variety of thin-skinned dumplings with meat, seafood or vegetable filling enclosed in tender wheat dough wrappers. Many sources suggest that the origins of wontons date back to the Han dynasty era, when they used to be prepared for the Chinese ancestor worship rituals as offerings to the spirits of the deceased. As the Han era concluded, circa 220 CE, the northern Chinese farmers who had long grown wheat discovered they could ground this grain into flour and knead it with water. From this practice emerged an entire world of new dishes known as <em>bing</em>, which was a collective name for steamed breads, grilled flatbreads, noodles, and various dumplings. These dishes soon became so popular they were sold anywhere from river boat food vendors to the streets, enjoyed both by royalty and the common folk. Over time, wontons have evolved and spread from Northern China throughout the country and beyond. Traditionally prepared during the Winter Solstice Festival, they were cooked in chicken broth until almost translucent and enjoyed as a heartwarming soup typically flavored with white pepper, sesame, and oyster oil. Nowadays, wontons are available in numerous varieties. In the North, they are most often stuffed with pork or lamb, while the classic Shanghainese filling includes minced pork and <em>bok choy</em> cabbage, flavored with the wild green called <em>shepherd&rsquo;s purse</em>. Further to the south, people make their wontons with egg wrappers and fill them with a combination of pork and shrimp, while in Cantonese cuisine, wontons are often served as an appetizer, deep-fried and smothered in sweet-and-sour sauce. In the neighboring province of Fujian, they are better known as <em>bianshi</em> and are sometimes stuffed with fish paste. The so-called <em>three treasure wontons</em>, also known as <em>Sanxian huntun</em> or <em>wuxi Sanxian</em> wontons are stuffed with pork, dried shrimps, and pickled vegetables, and typically served in a spicy tofu and egg soup. Sichuan pork wontons are called <em>chao shou</em>, and they are traditionally served either in <em>qing tang</em>, a clear vegetable broth flavored with cilantro and other leafy greens, or in a spicy <em>hong you</em> chili oil sauce. Hong Kong-style wontons are filled with shrimp and lightly seasoned pork flavored with ginger, yellow chives, soy sauce, and sesame oil.</p>",

However, it is universally agreed that the meat must be moist, succulent, and tender, coated with a crunchy, golden-brown crust. It all started during the colonization period, when Scottish immigrants settled in the South, bringing their fried chicken recipes along. The African slaves then introduced new seasonings and spices, and the dish quickly gained popularity. Typical seasonings include salt, pepper, and hot chiles, and the pieces of meat should be edible by hand so that the consumer can bite both the crust and the meat at the same time. The birds must be fresh and smaller in size, as the meat will be much more tender and the proportion of crust to meat will be perfectly balanced. Once the chicken parts are hot, crispy, and ready to be consumed, they are traditionally accompanied by buttered biscuits, Southern potato salad, mashed potatoes, or cream gravy on the side.</p>",

    "Name":"Nachos",
    "Description":"<p>The first, original plate of nachos consisting of tortilla chips, melted chips, and jalape&ntilde;os was made for a group of military officers' wives in 1943 in Piedras Negras, Mexico. The ladies of the US Army Air Force base went over to a restaurant in the city, called the <em>Victory Club</em>. Its maitre d', Ignacio \"Nacho\" Anaya couldn't find the cook, so he combined some readily available ingredients for the ladies and presented them with canapes of tortilla chips, cheese, and jalape&ntilde;o peppers. Nachos were created, and Anaya became the restaurant's head chef a few years later. The dish was named after his nickname, and was advertised on both sides of the border as <em>Nacho Specials</em>. The combination of chips and melted cheese quickly gained popularity, so by the 1960s, it became a staple of Tex-Mex cuisine. Some people credit a man named Frank Liberto for turning the nachos into a global phenomenon, since he is the one who turned the dish into stadium food in the United States, greatly increasing the sales of nachos and boosting their popularity even more. Today, common toppings include ingredients such as beans, <em>elote</em> corn, guacamole, lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and meat, and there is even a special event called the <em>International Nacho Festival</em>, held every October in Piedras Negras.</p>",

The name of the dish stems from <em>bool</em> and <em>kogi</em>, Korean words denoting <em>fire</em> and <em>meat</em>. The earliest form of the dish originates from the Goguryeo period, when the meat was marinated before grilling, unlike the standard Chinese practice of seasoning the meat after it has been grilled. The marinade traditionally consists of honey, sesame, soy sauce, garlic, and scallions, while the alternatives for beef, chicken, and pork can be either tofu, shrimp, or squid. Typical for Korean food, the meat always comes to the table with a variety of accompaniments and side dishes such as rice, lettuce leaves, scallion pancakes, kimchi, and the omnipresent <em>gochujang</em>. What harissa is to Moroccan cuisine and what ketchup is to burgers and hot dogs in the USA, gochujang is to bulgogi, a fiery hot condiment made from dried chili peppers, soybean paste, and rice powder, all slowly fermented in huge clay pots, giving a pungent kick both to bulgogi, served at every Korean dinner party, and a variety of other meat and rice dishes.</p>",

One of the most popular Korean dishes besides bulgogi and kimchi, bibimbap is said to have been invented out of necessity, just like many other national dishes. In Korea, there is a tradition that any leftover food from New Year's Eve should not be brought over into the New Year, so it started the practice of combining different ingredients with rice in a bowl, and bibimbap was created. Another theory says that it was a traditional dish for the workers during the harvest, as it is easily prepared in large quantities to feed a large number of people, and the first time that the dish was mentioned by name is found in a 19th century cookbook called <em>Siuijeonseo</em>. Regardless of its origins, Koreans claim that it heals the body, releases energy, and protects the consumers from illness during winter, so it is not a wonder that bibimbap is regarded as the ultimate comfort food.</p>",

As a result of such popularity, many other fried dishes were developed using ham, beef, minced patties, and chicken as substitutes. For serving, tonkatsu is sliced, then placed on a plate together with shredded cabbage. Rice and miso come in separate bowls, while pickled vegetables and a citrus-based sauce are placed on the side.

Dashi is typically made from <em>kombu</em> (dried kelp), <em>katsuobushi</em> (dried and smoked skipjack tuna), <em>iriko</em> or <em>niboshi</em> (anchovies or sardines), or a combination of these ingredients, all of which are naturally rich in glutamates and thus deliver an intense <em>umami</em> flavor to a number of Japanese dishes. There are several types of dashi and deciding on which kind of dashi to use for a particular dish depends solely on one's preference. <em>Awase dashi</em> is the most common all-purpose seafood-based stock made from a combination of kombu and bonito flakes. It is most often used for preparing dishes such as <em>miso soup</em>, <em>oyakodon</em>, <em>oden</em>, <em>nikujaga</em>, <em>chikuzenni</em>, <em>tamagoyaki</em>, etc. <em>Kombu dashi</em> is a vegetarian stock made exclusively with kombu; it has a mild flavor and goes well with either vegetable or fish-based dishes such as yudofu or clamp soup, as it doesn't overpower other flavors. <em>Iriko</em> or <em>niboshi dashi</em> is a seafood-based stock made from dried baby anchovies or sardines; it has a strong fishy aroma, but its flavor is not as strong. Compared to katsuobushi and kombu, this dashi is more affordable and most commonly used for making miso soup, noodle soup dishes like <em>curry udon</em> or <em>kitsune udon</em>, as well as various donburi and nimono dishes. <em>Shiitake dashi</em> is another vegetarian stock made by rehydrating dried shiitake mushrooms. It is rarely used on its own; instead, it is usually combined with other kinds of dashi to enhance the flavor and add umami to various noodle soups and simmered dishes.</p>",

    "Description":"<p>Usually accompanied by a glass of milk or a cup of hot tea or coffee, chocolate chip cookies are well balanced between salty and sweet in flavor, tenderly chewy in texture, and filled with small melting chocolate pyramids, bringing a generation of Americans back to their childhood. The origin story of these sweet treats is incredibly interesting, almost as the cookies themselves. The Toll House Inn was a popular bed-and-breakfast in Whitman, Massachusetts, bought by Ruth Graves Wakefield and her husband in 1930. Ruth's cooking was so good that the inn gained an excellent reputation in a short span of time. Enter Duncan Hines, a traveling salesman from Kentucky who began compiling a list of the best roadside eateries in 1935. First, he included the Toll House Inn's Indian pudding on the list, and a decade later, he also included the chocolate chip cookies that we all know and love today. Ruth was baking chocolate cookies when she found out that she didn't have any more baker's chocolate. Instead, she used a new, semisweet chocolate that she got from her friend Andrew Nestl&eacute;, broke it into small pieces, and places them in her batter for buttered sugar cookies. The chocolate didn't melt like she thought it would, and the result was a cookie that Ruth originally called the <em>Toll House chocolate crunch cookie</em>. The Boston press published her recipe, and the sales of both Nestl&eacute; chocolate and the cookies skyrocketed. Nestl&eacute; and Wakefield made a deal - he would print the recipe on the chocolate, and she would get a lifetime supply of chocolate. The recipe is printed on the chocolate package up to this day, giving everyone a chance to make their own chocolate chip cookies.</p>",

The word <em>fajita</em> is derived from the Spanish <em>faja</em>, meaning <em>girdle</em> or <em>strip</em>, referring to a cheap cut of beef covering the diaphragm that was considered somewhat undesirable by many locals. In the 1940s, Mexican ranch workers used to tenderize the skirt steak by pounding and marinating it in lime juice before cooking it over an open fire and serving the meat in a wheat tortilla along with numerous condiments. Today, fajitas can be filled with grilled chicken, shrimp, and even vegetables, because the more popular the dish became, the less likely it was to be made with skirt steak. Typical condiments include ingredients such as lettuce, sour cream, cheese, tomatoes, or guacamole.</p>",

Even though it is common for Mexican food to be served with a variety of sauces and salsas, tamales are the exception because they are usually eaten plain and simple without any sauces, although it is not a rule set in stone. One of the first records of tamales dates back to the 1550s when the Spaniards were served the dish by the Aztecs who made them with beans, meat, and chiles. Today, the fillings can be anything from beans to chicken, fish, pork, hard cooked eggs, pumpkin seeds or squash. <em>Tamales rojo</em> (red tamales) are filled with shredded meat such as beef or pork in a red chili sauce. <em>Tamales verde</em> (green tamales) have the same meat and a different sauce made from sour, green tomatillos. <em>Tamales dulce</em>, the sweet variety, is filled with dried fruits such as raisins or berries. Hot and flavorful tamales vary by region. In Culiacan and Sinaloa, they like them with sweet brown beans, pineapple, and corn. In Oaxaca, tamales are drizzled with the regional speciality called <em>black mole</em>, and in Yucatan, there is a variety with a filling consisting of chicken, tomato, and achiote.

It consists of white flour, yeast, eggs, milk, salt, and sugar, baked in a tandoor oven. Its typical tear-drop shape is achieved by the way the dough droops as it cooks on the tandoor walls. Many Indian villages had a communal tandoor, placed in the middle of the village so that all the locals could bake naan. There are also many varieties of naan, such as <em>kulcha</em> (the flatbread is stuffed with a filling of nuts and raisins, potatoes, or onions) and <em>garlic naan</em>, topped with butter and crushed garlic. Traditionally, naan is served hot from the oven, slightly charred, brushed with ghee - Indian clarified butter, and it is usually consumed as an accompaniment to a variety of dishes.</p>",

    "Description":"<p>Probably the most iconic image of France, this long, light, airy bread with its characteristically crispy crust dates back to the 19th century, when wheat and white breads were no longer a privilege of the rich. Baguettes were made even before the invention of their name. The word baguette first entered use in 1920, derived from the Latin root <em>baculum</em>, meaning <em>stick</em> or <em>staff</em>, which became <em>baccheto</em> in Italian. Baguettes were first baked as long, wide loaves of bread, but a 1920 law prevented workers from beginning work before 4AM, making it impossible for bakers to finish baking the bread in time for breakfast. They then gave baguettes their typical long, thin shape in order to speed up the baking process. The bread was baked in steam ovens, which were first brought to Paris by an Austrian named August Zang, whom some French sources credit with the invention of the baguette. Another characteristic of the baguette is its typical flower-petal design on the top of the crust, made by making diagonal slashes with a curved knife on top of the loaves before they are put to bake. Today, baguettes can be found throughout France, and they are available for sale in nearly every boulangerie, as well as baked at home. The texture and flavor of a good baguette can transform any sandwich into a gourmet meal. Baguettes are also flexible &ndash; they can be made into bruschettas, turned into croutons or garlic bread, used for mopping up sauces, or simply dipped in olive oil as a snack.</p>",

    "Description":"<p>Ceviche is the national dish of Peru consisting of slices of raw fish or shellfish that is spiced with salt, onions, and chili peppers, then marinated in lime juice. Due to the acidity of lime juice, the texture of the fish changes, as does its color &ndash; from pink to white. The acidic marinade, also known as<em> leche de tigre</em> (lit. tiger's milk) \"cooks\" the meat without any heat involved in the process. For ceviche, fresh fish is an imperative, as fish and shellfish that are not fresh can cause food poisoning. Peruvians are used to fresh ingredients, so the fish will sometimes be prepared for ceviche less than an hour after being caught. Fish for ceviche can be divided into three categories: firm, medium, and soft. The dish was originally made by the natives who marinated fish and <em>amarillo</em> chiles in the juices of a native fruit called <em>tumbo</em>, which was replaced by lime juice when the Spanish brought limes and onions to the country. The flavors of ceviche are slightly acidic and spicy, with an intense aroma of the sea. Traditionally, it is served on a bed of lettuce with tiny pieces of corn, chunks of sweet potato, and boiled yuca. <em>Cancha</em>, a variety of popcorn made from large corn kernels toasted in salt and oil provides an ideal side dish. The dish is traditionally served at <em>cevicherias</em>, specialized ceviche restaurants that can be found all over the country, and it is so popular that it even has its day, known as National Ceviche Day.</p>",

    "Description":"<p>The carbonara we know today is prepared by simply tossing spaghetti with <em>guanciale</em> (cured pork jowl), egg yolks, and Pecorino Romano cheese. Despite its simplicity, this dish remains one of Rome's favorites, equally popular throughout the country. Even though carbonara is considered a typical Roman dish today, its origins are quite vague and often disputed. The name is said to have been derived from the <em>carbonari</em>, woodcutters and charcoal-makers who lived in the Appenine mountains northeast of Rome, and who supposedly cooked their pasta over a hardwood charcoal fire and tossed it with eggs and cheese. Another popular theory claims that carbonara was invented after the liberation of Rome in 1944, when food shortages were so severe that Allied troops distributed bacon and powdered eggs, which the local population would then mix with water to make pasta sauce.</p>",

    "Description":"<p>Guacamole is a world-famous buttery delicacy dating back all the way to the Aztec empire of the 1500s. It&rsquo;s a healthy blend of ripe, mashed avocados, onions, chiles, optional tomatoes and selected seasonings such as sea salt and coriander. The star of this incredibly simple dish is the avocado, high in unsaturated fat, potassium, vitamins, minerals and protein, its name stemming from the Aztec <em>ahuacatl</em>, meaning <em>testicle</em> or <em>testicle tree</em>, which is why it was believed that it was an aphrodisiac by the Aztecs. Guacamole is sometimes prepared in the <em>molcajete</em>, a traditional Mexican mortar and pestle where onions, chiles, and salt are ground to a paste and added to the coarsely mashed avocados. Of course, guacamole is only as good as the avocados it is prepared with, and among the best are the nutty and creamy <em>Hass</em> and smooth <em>Fuerte</em> avocados. It is usually accompanied by corn chips, nachos or tortillas on the side, so guacamole is used as a side dish or a dip. Regardless of its position on the table, the only important thing is to serve it fresh before it oxidizes and changes its vivid, green color to a darker brown hue.</p>",

A sundae is ice cream topped with a sauce or syrup, typically served in a bowl. The most popular varieties of sundae are chocolate caramel, butterscotch, and strawberry. Cherries, dairy cream, and nuts are the most common additions to the popular treat. Food historians still argue about the origin of the ice cream sundae, but there are three theories which remain the most popular. The first one says it was created in Illinois, where the law prohibited the selling of soda water on a Sunday. As an alternative, local soda fountains started selling ice cream sodas without the soda, leaving the customers with only syrup and ice cream, known as sundaes. The second theory says that it was invented in Wisconsin by a soda fountain owner named Ed Berners, who served ice cream topped with syrup used for sodas to his customers. Berners loved the dish and charged a nickel for it. His competitor, George Giffy, started to serve the dessert on Sundays. Once he started to make money, he changed the name from Ice Cream Sunday to Ice Cream Sundae and served it every day of the week. The last theory suggests that the sundae was first made in Ithaca, New York by Chester Platt, a drugstore owner who served a dish of vanilla ice cream, cherry syrup, and candied cherries to one Reverend John Scott, and he named the dish after the day. Regardless of its inventor, today there are over hundred types of sundaes, offered in numerous flavors such as pineapple, blueberry, banana, raspberry, or marshmallow, among others.</p>",

Sometimes, it is cut into wedges and served with salsa or guacamole on the side, and it can be topped with vegetables such as diced tomatoes, onions, lettuce, or hot chiles. The origins of quesadilla are somewhat murky, but it is known that the cheese was brought to Mexico by the Spaniards along with other dairy products in colonial times, and the thin flatbreads were already a staple of the Mesoamerican people. The Spaniards named the dish quesadilla (<em>little cheesy thing</em>). In northern Mexico, and parts of the southwestern United States, flour tortillas are more common than corn tortillas, so quesadillas with flour tortillas started to gain popularity throughout the United States as well. Today, there are numerous varieties and fillings for quesadillas such as chorizo, Oaxaca cheese, epazote, and squash blossoms.</p>",

They are typically served in small, round bowls and consumed along with the main dish. Chutney's role is to cool the palate and bring even more flavors and colors to the table. Most families take great pride in their homemade chutneys, their houses decorated with rows upon rows of jars that were left to mature in the sun on windowsills. It is common to serve more than one chutney, so a hostess is often judged by the number and variety of chutneys she serves to her guests. <em>Mint chutney</em> is the most popular variety, traditionally eaten with samosas and consisting of fresh mint leaves, onions, garlic, and lemon juice. <em>Coconut chutney</em>, another favorite, consists of grated coconut, ginger, kari leaves, chiles, and garlic. Other types of chutney can be made with green mangoes, tomatoes, sour cherries, coriander, peanut, and apples, all of them with vivid colors, sweet, spicy, and sour at the same time. Chutney got its name from an Anglicized version of the Sanskrit word <em>chatni</em>, which literally translates to <em>licking good</em>, and it is obvious to anyone who tried it that it lives up to its name.</p>",

    "Description":"<p>Churrasco is a Brazilian barbecue method where juicy pieces, slices, steaks, and chops of beef, veal, lamb, pork, and chicken are placed on big skewers and grilled over wood fire. It started in the early 1800s when the Gauchos (European immigrants that settled in the Rio Grade do Sul area) would get together and start a fire, adding large portions of meat on skewers and slowly grilling the meat. In the restaurants, known as <em>churrascarias</em>, the skewers are paraded across the restaurant in a flashy manner, and the waiters circulate among the tables in order to show off the succulent meat to hungry diners. After the customers have chosen their preferred type of meat, it is sliced off the skewers to the dining plates. Also known as <em>rod&iacute;zio</em>, the theme of this barbecue experience is <em>all you can eat</em>, so the customers should know to come with an empty stomach. Beef is the most popular option, although livers and hearts are especially rich and chewy. In Brazil, the meat will often be from the <em>zebu</em>, a succulent, lean breed of cattle with a hump that's especially popular in churrasco as a cut of meat called <em>cupim</em>. Churrasco starts with appetizers and a variety of salads offered from a big buffet, as a preview of things to come. The usual accompaniments for the meat include farofa grains, rice, fried potatoes, potato salad, steamed greens, black beans, onions, fried bananas, and numerous chili-based sauces. After the big meal, it is typical to consume grilled pineapple slices, serving as a palate cleanser as well as a tasty dessert. Churrasco (lit. barbecue) is also popular as a cooking method in countries such as Nicaragua, Puerto Rico, Argentina, Uruguay, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Chile, and each country has their own favorite cuts of meat and accompaniments for this popular barbecue style.</p>",

    "Name":"B??rek",
    "Description":"<p>B&ouml;rek is a baked dish consisting of a savory or sweet filling wrapped in <em>yufka</em> - thinly stretched sheets of dough made with flour, water, and salt. Heartier than phyllo, but thinner than a tortilla, hand-made yufka is typically brushed with butter before baking. Although many countries have their own versions of this satisfying dish, it was probably invented during the Ottoman Empire in the Anatolian Provinces, an area that nowadays belongs to Turkey. Some sources suggest that b&ouml;rek might be even older, a descendant of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Anatolian dish known as <em>en tyritas plakountas</em>, consisting of layered dough filled with cheese, its recipe dating back to 160 BC. Nowadays, Turkey is famous for its layered pies and pastries, all united under the name b&ouml;rek (also <em>burek, byurek, byrek, b&ouml;regi</em>). Regardless of many b&ouml;rek varieties, yufka always remains the same, and almost everything wrapped in it may be called b&ouml;rek, which could also explain the name: some suggest that it comes from the Turkish word <em>bur</em>, meaning <em>to twist</em>. In Turkey, there are many regional variations of b&ouml;rek, and the names usually contain a descriptive word referring to the shape, ingredients, cooking method, or a region where the specific variety of b&ouml;rek comes from. For example, <em>su b&ouml;re??i</em> or <em>water b&ouml;rek</em> is made with boiled sheets of dough which are buttered and filled with a mixture of feta cheese and parsley (an alternative recipe suggests minced meat and onions), then baked. <em>Kalem b&ouml;regi</em> or <em>pen b&ouml;rek</em> is a thin, cigarette-shaped variety that is often served in restaurants as an appetizer. Due to their shape, they were originally called <em>sigara b&ouml;re??i</em>, but in 2011, Turkish pastry chefs started calling them <em>kalem</em> to avoid the connections with smoking. They are usually filled with feta cheese, potatoes, and parsley, but can also be enriched with minced meat or sausages, and vegetables such as spinach, nettles, leeks, and courgettes. <em>Pa&ccedil;anga b&ouml;re??</em>i is a deep-fried variety from Istanbul, filled with past??rma or ka??ar and chopped green peppers. <em>Saray b&ouml;re??i</em> or <em>palace b&ouml;rek</em> is a truly decadent version made with fresh butter rolled between each sheet of dough, while <em>kol b&ouml;re??i</em> or <em>arm b&ouml;rek</em> is the classic variety prepared at home - shaped in long rolls, either rounded or lined, it is usually filled with minced meat, feta cheese, spinach, or potatoes (it's smaller and fattier variety is called <em>sar??yer b&ouml;re??i</em>, named after Sar??yer, a district of Istanbul where it is traditionally prepared). The most beautiful variety might be <em>g&uuml;l b&ouml;re??i</em> or <em>rose b&ouml;rek</em>, arranged in a spiral that resembles a rose filled with various fillings which are often spicy in flavor. <em>&Ccedil;i?? b&ouml;rek</em> or <em>raw b&ouml;rek</em> is a half-moon-shaped variety filled with raw minced meat and fried in oil. On the other hand, there is also <em>t&ouml;b&ouml;rek</em> - a similar variety which is baked instead of fried. However, b&ouml;rek doesn't have to be savory - a sweet variety called <em>laz b&ouml;re??i</em> is prepared in the Rize region. It is filled with <em>muhallebi</em> (a local spin on custard) and served generously dusted with powdered sugar. Another sweet variety is called <em>k&uuml;rt b&ouml;re??i</em>, also known as <em>sade</em>, meaning <em>plain b&ouml;rek</em>, referring to the fact that it has no filling at all, just a generous layer of powdered sugar on top. Seeing all these varieties, it is clear that b&ouml;rek may be one of the most significant dishes of the Turkish cuisine &ndash; it surely is one of the oldest and most traditional ones.</p>",

Fondue's key ingredient is cheese that is melted over a fire, with a lot of regional varieties and flavorful additions such as cherry brandy, white wine, or a sprinkle of nutmeg. It was invented out of necessity, when the alpine locals and traveling herders relied only on cheese, wine, and bread to get them through the winter. As the summer cheese dried out and bread became stale during the winter months, the people started to melt cheese with wine and dip pieces of stale bread into it. Traditionally, fondue is prepared in a flameproof casserole called a <em>caquelon</em>. The dish varies from region to region: <em>fondue Neuchatel</em> uses Gruy&eacute;re and Emmental, <em>fondue Vandois</em> adds a lot of garlic, while <em>fondue Fribourg</em> is prepared with ripe <em>Vacherin</em> cheese. Pieces of bread are placed on traditional, long-handled fondue forks used for swirling the bread in cheese.

Although churros are a Madrid specialty, the ones found in Seville are often praised because they differ in a lighter and more delicate texture.

    "Name":"Miso Soup",
    "Description":"<p>Miso soup is a traditional Japanese soy-based soup made from a stock called <em>dashi</em>, miso paste, and various additional ingredients such as seaweed or tofu. It is estimated that more than 70% of Japeanese people consume the soup for breakfast, although it is commonly available at any time of the day. In Japanese restaurants in the United States, miso soup is often offered as an appetizer. The soup is thought to have medicinal properties, as it alkalizes the blood and revives the nervous system. The main ingredient is called miso - a combination of rice, salt, water, and fermented soybeans, shaped into a paste that is similar to peanut butter in texture. Miso is centuries old, and its roots are in <em>chiang</em> - a fermented soybean paste invented in China by Buddhist priests more than 2500 years ago. Since miso soup is relatively quick and easy to prepare, in Japan, there are even instant cups of the soup available in vending machines for a small amount of money, acting as a testament to the soup's enormous popularity.</p>",

In fact, in the Kahramanmara?? region, ice cream typically contains distinctly more salep than usual, which is why it is sometimes called <em>kesme dondurma</em>&mdash;from the Turkish <em>kesmek</em>, meaning <em>to cut</em>&mdash;which is the reason why this ice cream variety is usually eaten with a knife and fork. In Turkey, ice cream is commonly sold in the streets but also in specialized <em>dondurmas??</em> shops, whose owners will often go out of their way by producing their own salep, apart from using exclusively natural flavorings and milk from goats fed only with thyme, orchid flowers, and <em>milkvetch</em>.</p>",

    "Name":"Apple Pie",
    "Description":"<p>Although England has a long history of making meat and fruit pies, and it was the inspiration for the American versions, there is nothing that is more synonymous with American desserts than the apple pie. In the United States, apple pies are found everywhere from big grocery shops and restaurants to coffee shops and home bakers, baked until the double crust is golden brown, filled with cinnamon-sugar coated apples. Homemade American apple pie is a source of great pride, causing arguments about which apple variety is the most suitable for the best pies. Some swear by <em>Granny Smiths</em>, but they are sour and require too much sugar, resulting in a soggy crust. Others prefer <em>Golden Delicious</em>, the driest, but the least flavorful variety. Experts opt for the tart <em>Cortland</em> or the flavorful <em>Northern Spy</em> varieties, both at their prime between September and November. However, apple varieties are not the only concern. What about the crust? Should it be flaky and buttery or thin, crispy and based on lard? For a sweet and savory combination, some even replace half of the butter with Cheddar cheese, resulting in an unusual apple pie with a cheesy crust. The most popular variety in the US is probably <em>apple pie &agrave; la mode</em>, invented in Minnesota in 1885, and served with a scoop of ice cream on top. Regardless of the regional varieties and endless debates, apple pie is an American dessert like no other, best paired with a sweet Riesling wine.</p>",

    "Name":"Grilled Cheese",
    "Description":"<p>Grilled cheese is a classic American sandwich that is usually prepared with one or more cheese varieties that are placed between two slices of bread. The slices are buttered from the outside, and the sandwich is then shortly heated, typically in a pan or on a griddle, until the bread is golden and the cheese melts. Although cheese and bread were a common pairing since the early 1900s, and the French have their own, similar <em>Croque Monsieur</em> sandwich, <em>grilled cheese</em> sandwich first appeared in the United States in the 1920s, when it was prepared open-faced, as a slice of bread topped with shredded cheese. It rose in popularity due to the fact that it was inexpensive and affordable. In the 1960s, a second slice of bread was added on top, and the classic grilled cheese as we know today was invented, due to the availability of pre-sliced bread and processed cheese singles. Today, the sandwich has evolved into various creations, as innovators started serving it on bagels, adding different kinds of cheese, meat, and vegetables such as bacon, tomatoes, and avocado into it. Grilled cheese still remains a staple of comfort food and the children's favorite, although it is often consumed by many adults, and it is even served in some high-end restaurants. For many people, there is nothing better than pairing a hot grilled cheese sandwich with a bowl of tomato soup, and it is believed that the comforting combination is best when consumed on a cold, rainy night.</p>",

Some believe that gyros originated during the time of Alexander the Great, when his soldiers skewered the meat on their swords and cooked it over a fire. Others claim that gyros was introduced to Greece in 1922, with the refugees from Constantinople and Smyrna. Many of the refugees became merchants and opened their shops with tiny holes in the wall, where gyros was sold. After WWII, gyros gained popularity and spread to Europe, Australia, and the United States. Today, gyros is known as one of the most popular street food varieties around the world.</p>",

    "Name":"Pizza Napoletana",
    "Description":"<p>Italy&rsquo;s most emblematic culinary creation, the genuine pizza Napoletana is made with just a few simple ingredients and prepared in only two variations &ndash; <em>marinara</em>, the basic Neapolitan pizza topped with a tomato-based sauce flavored with garlic and oregano, and <em>margherita</em>, which is topped with tomatoes, mozzarella, and fresh basil leaves, a delicious combination whose colors are said to represent the Italian flag. The crust is very thin at the base, and the dough puffs up on the sides, which results in airy crust that should have typical charred 'leopard spots' if baked properly. The origins of this iconic Neapolitan dish can be traced to the early 1700s, when what we know today as pizza marinara was first described by Italian chef, writer, and philosopher Vincenzo Corrado in his treatise on the eating habits of the people of Naples. Almost 200 years later, in 1889, the premier Neapolitan master pizzaiolo Raffaele Esposito added mozzarella to the mix and invented the margherita, which is now generally cited as the first modern pizza. Originally dubbed <em>la pizza tricolore</em>, Esposito&rsquo;s creation is said to have been made in honor of and named after Margherita of Savoy, the Queen consort of the Kingdom of Italy, who was visiting Naples at the time. In 2010, as one of Italy&rsquo;s most popular foods worldwide, pizza Napoletana was officially recognized by the European Union and granted the designation of Traditional Specialty Guaranteed. And remember, a good pizza Napoletana doesn't need any additions other than the designated toppings.</p>",

Although each region has its own distinctive type, most nougats are made of whipped egg white mixed with roasted chopped nuts such as almonds, pistachios, walnuts, and hazelnuts. The result is a sweet treat with a chewy consistency. The exact origin of nougat is hard to trace, but the first recipe for a sweet resembling white nougat called <em>natif</em> was recorded in a 10th-century book found in Baghdad. Nougat can be divided into numerous categories, but the most basic distinction is made between soft or hard nougat, depending on whether it is made with honey or sugar. In Italy, nougat is known as <em>torrone</em>, and each city and region has its own traditional type of torrone, ranging from hard versions made with sugar to soft and chewy honey-based varieties. French nougat is predominately made without eggs and with a larger proportion of nuts, while the Spanish usually use roasted almonds and raw honey. Viennese nougat is somewhat different from the other types &ndash;it is made of finely ground cocoa butter, nuts, and cocoa mass, resulting in a soft chocolaty blend that is usually incorporated with other confections. Most traditional nougats are usually eaten on their own as a dessert or sweet snack, and the festive appearance of sliced nougat has earned it a regular place on various regional holiday platters.</p>",

From the moment it originated in Java, satay has quickly spread throughout Southeast Asia, and eventually all over the world. The popularity of satay resulted in a number of varieties of the dish.

Once merely a snack of Italian farmers and olive pickers, the versatile bruschetta has grown into one of the most delicious antipasti Italian cuisine has to offer. While the original Roman bruschetta is flavored with only garlic and olive oil, both the Tuscan fettunta and Calabrian fedda ruscia are typically topped with chopped tomatoes, fresh basil, and sprinkled with either wild fennel seeds or oregano. Nowadays, bruschetta comes in virtually infinite varieties: spread with bell pepper, mushroom, eggplant, or zucchini p&acirc;t&eacute;s, and topped with small chunks of eggplant, figs, scamorza cheese, mozzarella, or even anchovies, prosciutto, or various types of salami. However, even though it might seem that there isn&rsquo;t much to this simple grilled bread appetizer, the secret to a perfect bruschetta is in its simplicity, and the delicate combination of garlic and olive oil shouldn&rsquo;t be overpowered with other flavors.</p>",

    "Description":"<p>This wildly popular French dessert is beloved all over the world &ndash; known to gourmets for its soft, airy texture, and infamous among chefs for its unforgiving nature, which leaves little to no room for error during the cooking process. This delicate cake consists of two elements: a pudding or cream base, and a meringue made of egg whites. Souffl&eacute;s can be either sweet or savory. Sweet souffl&eacute;s typically have a sauce in the middle, and are served almost exclusively as a dessert. Savory souffl&eacute;s often include ingredients such as cheese, crab, or onions, and they are usually served as an appetizer. The dish received its name from the French word <em>souffler</em>, meaning <em>to puff up</em>, and both sweet and savory versions of this delicacy were first created in 18th-century France. The first recipe for the dish is found in Vincent La Chapelle&rsquo;s 1742 book <em>Le Cuisinier Moderne</em>. Today, there are numerous variations of the dish, containing creative ingredients such as figs, kiwi, chicken, vegetables, broccoli, corn, pineapple, and sweet potato.</p>",

Dal is a stew with the main ingredient of black or yellow lentils&mdash;the most consumed ingredients in India&mdash;but it can also be prepared with peas, chickpeas, or mung beans. Inexpensive and easy to make, dal was an ideal food for the working class as it provided lots of energy for a full day of labor. While yellow lentils are most commonly used, black lentils are the most prized variety when making dal. Hulled and split, the slightly nutty lentils are slowly simmered with a variety of spices such as caraway, coriander, onions, garlic, chiles, and ginger until they break apart, and are then mashed into a smooth pur&eacute;e. In the northern Punjab region, black mung beans are among the most popular choices for dal and they are typically cooked with ghee (clarified butter), yogurt, onions, tomatoes, and a variety of spices until the dish develops its distinctive aroma and reaches the desired thickness. There are numerous types of dal, each with a different spice combination and flavors. The dish can be served either as a main meal or as a side, and it is traditionally served over rice, accompanied by naan or other Indian breads.</p>",

There are two bread varieties usually incorporated in tortas, the traditional French influenced <em>bolillos</em>, and the similar round <em>teleras</em>, which are an authentic Mexican product from Puebla. The rolls are sliced horizontally, buttered, and stuffed with the most popular Mexican ingredients such as beans, avocados, ham, queso, jalape&ntilde;os, and a myriad of other typical Mexican dishes like fried beef or chicken, shredded beef, roasted pork, and even <em>tamales</em>. Tortas are traditionally served cold, but in the 1960s, the hot, grill-heated varieties started to appear and soon became equally famous. There is not much known about the origin of this hearty sandwich, but it is believed that during the French colonization, French bakers introduced their tradition of baking bread to Mexicans, who modified it and created their popular varieties, which later became a staple of Mexican cuisine. The birthplace of the torta is usually associated with the city of Puebla, the place where traditional <em>telera</em> originated, but the location where they flourished was Mexico City. Although tortas have not been widely recognized outside of Mexico as tacos, burritos, and tortillas, they are a favorite meal eaten throughout the country. Tortas are usually sold at food stalls and small restaurants, popularly called <em>torterias</em>, widespread across Mexican cities. The variations and regionally influenced creations of tortas are endless. The most common ones are <em>cubana</em>, which usually combines at least four meat varieties and two types of cheese; <em>pepito</em>, made with marinated sliced steak; <em>cochinita</em>, made with slowly roasted pork; and <em>agohada</em>, a Guadalajara favorite made with pork and served in tomato sauce.</p>",

And even though there are as many varieties of chow mein in China as there are regional cuisines, the method of preparation is basically the same. The noodles are boiled and fried until crispy on the outside but still soft in the middle, then tossed with shredded pieces of meat (chicken, pork, beef or seafood) in a classic stir-fry sauce, which is often flavored with rice wine. Lastly, they are served topped with cabbage, celery, onions, mushrooms, or bean sprout shoots. Brought to the United States by Chinese immigrants in the 1850s, chow mein showed up on the menus of numerous Chinese restaurants not long after the Americans had already gone crazy about chop suey. Soon after, to win over Western palates, chow mein was - like many other foreign foods - heavily Americanized. Over time, it became more of a meat dish with deep-fried egg noodles smothered in thick gravy, having little resemblance to the authentic Chinese chow mein. However, with the culinary trends slowly reversing, people are nowadays turning to more traditional recipes.</p>",

Other ingredients in sukiyaki include sliced Chinese cabbage, mushrooms, leeks, gelatinous konnyaku noodles, and shungiku leaves. All the ingredients are then quickly cooked in a mixture of mirin, soy sauce, and sugar. Sukiyaki is a communal style dish, served in one pot, then shared among a larger group of people. There are two traditional ways hot to prepare sukiyaki, Kansai and Kanto style. Essentially, they differ in the order in which the ingredients are added to the broth. In the Kansai variety, all ingredients are added at the same time, while in the Kanto variety, the meat is cooked before any other ingredients are added. The tradition also suggests that before consumption, every morsel should be dipped into beaten eggs. It is believed that the dish was developed during the Meiji era, which started at the end of 19th century. At that time, Japan opened its borders and foreigners introduced new cooking styles and the tradition of eating meat. Since then, it has become one of the favorite communal style dishes in Japan, commonly shared among larger groups of people.</p>",

    "Description":"<p>Through history, the word <em>barbacoa</em> has been associated with numerous meanings. The first mention of the word had Caribbean origins, where it referred to a contraption created with a framework of sticks, and a method of preparing ingredients using that ancient appliance. Also, the popular belief is that the word <em>barbecue</em> has its origins in the same word. However, in Mexico, the word refers to a slightly different style of preparing and cooking meat. The traditional Mexican barbacoa methods involved digging a hole in the ground, lining the bottom and the sides of the hole with rocks, and additionally adding a layer of burning wood on top, allowing it to burn slowly and turn into coal. The next step was placing agave leaves on coals, and laying the prepared meat on top of it. The hole would be covered with a tin and firmly sealed with dirt. An additional flame would be lit on top, to keep animals away, and the meat would be left to cook overnight. This Mexican tradition is believed to have its origins in the ancient Mayan and Aztec cultures who used the same technique to cook meat. However, they did not use the word <em>barbacoa</em>, and it stays unclear when did the word referring to the ancient Caribbean creation began to be used to specify this old cooking technique. In some parts of Mexico the words <em>pibil</em>, <em>tatema</em>, and <em>birria</em> are used to describe similar dishes cooked under the ground, but it is believed that they are all styles of the barbacoa technique. The meat that is traditionally employed in the barbacoa are animal heads &ndash; goat and cow being the Mexican favorites. All the parts of the head are consumed in Mexico, and the eyeballs are considered to be the rarest and finest delicacy. Since consumption of animal heads is sometimes frowned upon, modern varieties employ other animal parts prepared using the same technique. Barbacoa is particularly popular in northern Mexico and the southern United States regions, which have been in close contact with Mexican tradition. In recent years, due to health and safety regulations, barbacoa can rarely be found in its traditional form. The holes were replaced by modern pressure cookers, which produce similar, but not identical dishes.</p>",

    "Description":"<p>This thick, creamy, and rich pur&eacute;ed soup traditionally includes ingredients such as cream, seafood, cognac or wine, and a combination of spices. The origin of its name is still debated &ndash; some claim that the word refers to a soup that is cooked twice (<em>bis cuits</em>), since the traditional way of making the soup involves first roasting the shellfish and then simmering them again in the flavorful broth. Another theory suggests it is related to the Bay of Biscay, whose cuisine typically uses spicy ingredients similar to those used in bisque. Bisque was first mentioned as a shellfish soup in the 17th century, leading food historians to suggest that it was originally a fisherman&rsquo;s dish that was designed to get the most flavor out of whatever ingredients were available. Today, the most popular version of the dish is <em>lobster bisque</em>, which is made using a long cooking process designed to make the dish as flavorful as possible.</p>",

The main distinction between the Indian and Japanese curries is that the Indian version uses a combination of spices, while Japanese kar?? is made with curry powder. There are three main version of kar?? in Japan - <em>kar?? raisu</em> (curry over rice), <em>kar?? udon</em> (curry over noodles), and <em>kar?? -pan</em> (a pastry filled with curry). The most popular variety, is, as expected, kar?? raisu, which is usually served with <em>fukujinzuke</em> pickles or Japanese scallions on the side.

Due to its simplicity, marinara acts as a versatile base for many Italian dishes. It originated in Naples in southern Italy, its name derived from the Italian word for sailors (<em>marinai</em>). Some say it was named after the sailors because marinara's ingredients didn't spoil easily, and the sauce could be prepared quickly, in about the same time it took pasta to cook, so the two made a flavorful and cheap meal for sailors on their voyages. By the early 1900s, marinara became a classic in the United States of America as well, due to a large number of Italian immigrants.

The dish is most commonly accompanied by lettuce, raw garlic, green chili peppers, kimchi, and green onions.

Its name is derived from two words: <em>teppan</em> or an <em>iron plate</em>, and <em>yaki</em>, meaning <em>grilled</em> or <em>broiled</em>. Teppanyaki refers to a variety of dishes cooked in the aforementioned way. Steaks, seafood, chopped vegetables, rice, and dough-based foods such as <em>yakisoba</em> fried noodles are some of the most popular types of teppanyaki. In Western restaurants, the iron plate is often placed in front of the customers so they can watch the chefs work. In traditional Japanese restaurants, each table will usually have an iron plate so the food can stay warm as it continues to cook lightly. Although the history of teppanyaki is somewhat murky, some oral traditions trace it back to family dining in feudal Japan, when people would gather around the central fire and prepare simple grilled dishes. Others trace it back to the early 20th-century Kobe, where fishmongers used to grill the catch of the day in front of the customers. The first modern teppanyaki restaurant in Japan is called <em>Misono</em>, and it was opened in Kobe in 1945, while the first American teppanyaki restauarant was opened in Manhattan in 1964 by a young Japanese wrestler, and it quickly captivated New Yorkers before it spread to the rest of the country.</p>",

The origins of BLT are hard to pin down, but some claim it was developed from bacon sandwiches that were originally prepared for teatime in the English countryside since Victorian times. BLT sandwich first appeared in British cookbooks in the late 1920s, and its popularity boomed in America after World War II due to these important factors: lettuce and tomato became available in supermarkets and women, who were usually housewives, began to work outside their homes in much greater numbers than before the war. Today, the sandwich is so popular that it even has its own month, called the National BLT Month, celebrated in April.</p>",

Since those times, Margherita has become one of the most popular pizza varieties in the world, and in 2009, it was protected as one of the three <em>Pizze Napoletane</em> with an STG European label of protection, proving its excellence in flavor, ingredients, and traditional pizza-making techniques.</p>",

Originally, it was made as a low-fat option for people who consumed ice cream, but it wasn't a big success due to the fact that most Americans preferred the sweet ice cream over the tart frozen yogurt. In the 1980s, its popularity was on the rise, but still couldn't match the popularity of ice cream. Today, improvements in the recipes and the production process have resulted in a smoother, creamier frozen yogurt, making it a more popular choice than ice cream for numerous dessert consumers. Nowadays, the interest in low-fat foods seems unabated, and it can best be seen by the annual sales of frozen yogurt in the United States, reaching 195 million dollars.</p>",

    "Description":"<p>A traditional campfire classic consisting of a roasted marshmallow and a layer of chocolate placed between two graham crackers - that's s'more, its name derived from a contraction of the phrase \"some more\", because everyone who tasted it was instantly hooked. The credit for the invention of this delicious nighttime snack goes to the Girl Scouts, who first published the recipe in their 1927 book called <em>Tramping and Trailing with the Girl Scouts</em>. That same recipe was credited to a woman named Loretta Scott Crew. The enduring popularity of s'mores is best explained by a few crucial facts - they're easy to make, induce a large dose of nostalgia, and are in the reach of any parent's budget. Today, there is even a National S'mores Day, celebrated every year on August 10.</p>",

    "Name":"Manj??",
    "Description":"<p>Manj?? is a steamed Japanese confectionery product shaped into various forms and incorporating different ingredients and flavors. Usually, there are two main parts of manju, the outer shell, created out of kneaded wheat or rice flour, and the creamy paste hidden inside the chewy outer layer. The most common variety is produced with wheat flour and filled with red bean paste, popularly called <em>anko</em> or <em>tsubuan</em>. The origins of manj?? probably lie in China but are nowadays traditionally associated with Japan. The origin story of this traditional treat says that the original Chinese creation had a meat filling, but was later altered by the Japanese vegetarian monks and stuffed with a semi-sweet red bean paste. Many varieties grew out of the original form, and the modern fillings include white bean paste and different creams flavored with citrus, fruit, chocolate or vanilla. The outer shell is most commonly made with wheat flour, but rice or any other starchy flour can be employed in its creation. Various colors are often added to the shell, creating an attractive and decorative dessert. Although it is typically considered a confectionery product, manj?? can also appear in savory forms and be eaten as a snack. These beautiful and decorative treats play an important part in Japanese culture. The red and white manj?? is often given as a thank-you-gift at weddings, and a special variety is often brought to funerals. It is also eaten as an everyday dessert and regarded as the favorite treat among the locals. Because of its alluring appearance, these petite sweets are often sold as traditional Japanese souvenirs.</p>",

Even though panna cotta (lit. cooked cream) wasn't mentioned in Italian cookbooks until the 1960s, today it is considered a traditional Piedmontese dessert, and the original recipe calls for only whole cream, sugar, vanilla, and gelatin. When made to perfection and properly chilled, panna cotta is silky smooth, deliciously creamy, and has a gentle wobble to it. For a slightly lighter version of this scrumptious dessert, use half-and-half instead of heavy cream, or simply dilute heavy cream with milk. According to Anna Del Conte, a renowned food writer and leading figure in Italian cuisine, classic Piedmontese panna cotta is served on its own or sometimes accompanied with Brutti ma buoni hazelnut meringue biscotti, while the Valle d&rsquo;Aosta version of panna cotta is flavored with a dash of peach eau-de-vie and garnished with red berry coulis. In other parts of Italy, panna cotta is frequently flavored with rum or sweet Marsala wine and topped with a generous drizzle of caramel sauce, which perfectly complements the seductive aroma of vanilla. Imagination being the only limit, variations on this elegant dessert are virtually endless, and it can be easily tailored to anyone&rsquo;s taste.</p>",

The basic recipe spread to France and Spain over time, where the bread is known as fouaisse and hogaza, respectively. Foccacia&rsquo;s pockmarked appearance results from indentations made in the dough to prevent large bubbles from appearing on its surface during baking.

An impassioned art lover, Cipriani named the new dish carpaccio in honor of painter Vittore Carpaccio, whose style and bold colors were reminiscent of the intense red color of raw meat.

Then it is rolled up, baked, and topped with sauces, onions, beans, or more cheese. This highly versatile dish is believed to have originated from a Mayan dish called <em>papadzules</em>, consisting of corn tortillas dipped in pumpkin pur&eacute;e and filled with chopped boiled eggs. From there, numerous variations developed throughout Mexico and outside of its borders. The word <em>enchilada</em>, which first appeared in print in 1885, comes from the Spanish word <em>enchilar</em>, meaning <em>to season with chile pepper</em>. Today, there are countless versions of enchiladas. In northern Mexico's Sonora, they make them open-faced, topped with black olives and a red chile sauce, while the New Mexico version is prepared by layering the tortillas in a tall stack with cheese and onions between each layer. Enchiladas have become so popular that there is even a <em>National Enchilada Day </em>(in the US)<em>,</em> celebrated every year on May 5, also known as <em>Cinco de Mayo</em>.</p>",

    "Description":"<p>French for <em>fatty liver</em>, this decadent, expensive food product is made by using a controversial force-feeding process known as <em>gavage</em>, in which corn is fed to ducks and geese (primarily to the hybrid male <em>Mulard</em> ducks) through a feeding tube. The livers of birds which are force-fed in this way are enlarged and full of a buttery, slightly sweet fat. Foie gras is prepared by melting the livers in their own juices with a sprinkle of salt, resulting in a supple product. Usually served chilled and in scoops or slices, the texture is similar to that of ice cream. Foie gras is easily spreadable and full of rich flavor. It is creamy pink in color, and the only thing you need to enjoy its flavor to the fullest is a slice of bread or a crusty baguette, or if you&rsquo;d like to enjoy it in the popular French style, serve it atop a salad. Try it chilled on a piece of toast paired with a few fresh figs. Foie gras is primarily produced in the French regions of Alsace and P&eacute;rigord, and according to French law, only foie gras made from force-fed ducks or geese can be called foie gras. However, the production or import of foie gras has been banned in many countries, including India, Australia, and a number of EU countries.</p>",

A beaten raw egg is sometimes stirred into the dish, while chopped green onions are a common garnish. Miso soup, salads, or kimchi are regular side dishes accompanying gy??don. It is said that the first version of gy??don stems from an old dish called <em>gy??nabe</em>, where thinly sliced beef is cooked with vegetables in a pot. The first popular version of gy??don appeared in 1862 in the Kant?? region, and it has remained an inexpensive, yet nourishing and flavorful dish until today.</p>",

For special events, there might be a dozen or two dozen zakuski served to the guests. Typically, zakuski include appetizers such as cold cuts of meat, salads, pirozhki, cured fishes, pickled vegetables, a selection of cheeses, bread, and caviar. Zakuski is the most important course, and most hosts will spend much more time preparing and arranging zakuski than preparing the main course. The origins of zakuski are still shrouded in a veil of mystery, but it is speculated that the custom arose before the 19th century as a way of feeding guests who traveled long distances and whose arrival couldn't be predicted, so they were fed small bites of food while the main meal was being prepared. A bottle of vodka often takes the center spot on the table, since the zakuski table is meant to accompany and enhance the experience of drinking it, and shots of vodka are often repeated throughout the meal. Along with butter and bread, such as white, black, or a combination of rye and wheat, caviar is the most famous part of zakuski, often served in glass containers and consumed on its own, or on a piece of toasted white bread.</p>",

    "Name":"Caesar Salad",
    "Description":"<p>The iconic Caesar salad was named after its creator Cesare (Caesar) Cardini, an Italian immigrant who lived in San Diego but, circumventing Prohibition laws in the United States, operated a popular restaurant in Tijuana, just south of the Mexican border. Back then, in the 1920s, during the Prohibition era, Tijuana was flourishing as many Californians, including Hollywood jet set, would often drive over to party and enjoy the good life. And just like it was the case with many other world-famous dishes, Caesar salad was invented through sheer ingenuity and improvisation. In 1924, on a busy 4th of July weekend, Cardini's restaurant was packed so when the renowned restaurateur realized he's running low on food supplies, as he didn't want to disappoint the customers, Caesar concocted a salad with what was left over in the kitchen. To animate the guests and add some flair to his new invention, Cardini prepared the salad tableside, as many restaurants still do today, tossing the crisp romaine lettuce with creamy coddled eggs, garlic-flavored croutons, parmesan cheese, olive oil, and Worcestershire sauce. Originally, the romaine leaves were coated with the dressing and placed on a serving plate in a circle, stem side out, so that the diners could enjoy their salad with fingers. In 1926, Alex Cardini, a former ace pilot in the Italian Air Force during WWI, joined his brother Caesar at his Tijuana restaurant. Back then, the dish was named <em>Aviator's salad</em> in honor of the pilots from San Diego's Rockwell Field Air Base who, reportedly, one morning &ndash; after a long night of drinking and missing curfew &ndash; woke up at Caesar's restaurant and enjoyed the salad prepared by Alex Cardini for breakfast. Later on, as the salad gained popularity with other Californian visitors, it was renamed to Caesar salad. Alex also added other ingredients to the already famed concoction, in particular anchovies, even though Caesar was said to be against that inclusion, claiming that the Worcestershire sauce was enough to provide the faint fishy flavor. Moreover, in 1948 Caesar Cardini established a patent on the salad dressing which is still today produced and marketed by Caesar Cardini Foods, Inc. as <em>Cardini's Original Caesar</em> dressing mix. Regardless of the two slightly different recipes and dressing variations, Caesar salad became a sensation sought after from coast to coast, eventually even becoming a success in Europe; especially after the Paris-based International Society of Epicures in 1953 proclaimed it as \"the greatest recipe to originate from the Americas in 50 years\".</p>",

His prototype nugget mastered two challenges: keeping ground meat intact without putting a skin around it, and making batter stick to the meat in spite of the explosive heat of deep-frying. Baker invented the nuggets as a way to boost poultry sales, turning it into convenience food that appealed to lazy cooks. Today, chicken nuggets are one of the most popular items on the McDonald's menu, with their first noted appearance in 1980.</p>",

    "Name":"Tandoori",
    "Description":"<p>The most popular Indian dishes are those cooked over a blazing fire in the so-called <em>tandoor</em>, a cylindrical open-top clay oven fueled by wood or charcoal. The tandoori technique evolved from an old Middle Eastern method of baking bread, which spread to other parts of the continent, including northwestern India, where people began experimenting with cooking meats and other foods in tandoors, adding special marinades and spice rubs, both of which are now integral parts of Indian-style tandoori cooking. The marinade used in most tandoori dishes starts with yogurt; it holds well to the meat, lends a note of mild acidity, and keeps the herbs and spices in place. Even though the clay ovens themselves impart a special flavor to the food, most of it comes from the traditional combination of spices. Tandoori dishes are typically either intensely red or yellow colored, depending on the marinade ingredients: the red is provided by ground annatto seeds, while the yellow comes from saffron or turmeric. In addition, tandoori dishes are also traditionally flavored with ginger, garlic, coriander, cayenne pepper, and a combination of roasted and ground cardamom, cumin, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and black pepper called <em>garam masala</em>. This spice mixture imparts a mellow but savory flavor to tandoori dishes, whereas the heat can be adjusted to one's liking by adding more or less cayenne pepper. Apart from flatbreads such as <em>naan</em>, <em>roti</em>, <em>paratha</em> and <em>kulcha</em>, some of the typical tandoor-cooked dishes include a roasted paste of cashews, corn and cottage cheese called <em>peshawari seekh</em>; roasted potatoes stuffed with cottage cheese, vegetables and cashew nuts called <em>balochi aloo</em>; and Indian classics like <em>paneer tikka, chicken tikka</em>, <em>tandoori chicken</em>, and <em>kalmi kebab</em>.</p>",

    "Name":"Thanksgiving Dinner",
    "Description":"<p>For most Americans, the Thanksgiving dinner usually includes seasonal dishes such as stuffed roasted turkey and side dishes such as mashed potatoes, a rich cranberry sauce, and pumpkin pie, among others. This celebratory meal dates back to November 1621, when the Pilgrims and the Native Wampanoag Indians got together at Plymouth for an autumn harvest celebration, now considered America's first Thanksgiving. The first feast contained turkey, venison, fish, clams, berries, lobster, pumpkin, waterfowl, and squash, and many of the foods remained a staple of modern Thanksgiving dinners. Turkey is so synonymous with the holiday that the day is sometimes colloquially called <em>Turkey Day</em>. Today, the dinner centers on cooking and sharing a plentiful meal with close family and friends, and it is so popular that there are annual Thanksgiving parades throughout the United States, the largest and most famous of them being <em>Macy's</em> parade in New York City, featuring marching bands, floats, and performers, and attracting about two to three million spectators to the streets.</p>",

    "Description":"<p>Chashu is slowly braised pork belly, a staple Japanese dish infused with traditional flavors of soy sauce and sake. The dish can be made with flat pork belly, but the pieces can also be rolled to create more sophisticated versions which cook more evenly. Prepared pork belly is covered in a fragrant mixture of soy sauce, mirin, sake, and sugar. The liquid is additionally seasoned with sliced ginger and scallions, and the meat is braised on low heat for hours, until it soaks up all the layered flavors and turns the thick pork belly into an incredibly soft, tender, and juicy piece of meat. If the skin is left on the meat, it will caramelize during braising, becoming slightly gelatinous and affecting the final texture of the dish. The name and origin of this Japanese classic probably stems from <em>char siu</em>, the popular Chinese roasted pork dish. It was adapted with traditional Japanese ingredients to create a simple treat that is eaten throughout Japan. Sliced chashu is the essential component of legendary ramen dishes, but it can also be used as a stuffing inside bread and sandwiches or as a topping for other noodle and rice dishes.</p>",

Although the name of the dish translates to <em>ribs</em>, chicken or pork meat can also be used. The dish originates from 18th-century Korea, when killing cows was strictly forbidden. As workers were building the Hwa Castle, they needed to be well-fed, so King Jeongjo allowed the opening of only one slaughterhouse in the whole country to process beef and feed the hungry workers. Of course, it didn't stop at just one slaughterhouse, and that is the best reccomendation for trying the dish for yourself. Galbi is typically accompanied by kimchi, red bean paste or rice, but it can also be wrapped up in lettuce leaves with a variety of other vegetables. Due to kalbi's great balance of sweet and savory flavors and rising popularity, the dish even has its own annual festival since 1995, called the Suwon Galbi Festival, offering the visitors a chance to indulge in this celebrated delicacy.</p>",

    "Description":"<p>Also known as <em>dry-frying</em>, karaage is a Japanese cooking technique in which various foods are first lightly coated in arrowroot starch, then deep-fried. The use of arrowroot starch preserves the natural water content of fried foods and produces a crispy outer surface, but alternatively, other coating ingredients such as wheat flour, tapioca, or potato starch can also be used. Karaage can be used for frying various meats and fish, but it is most often associated with chicken, and involves a special variant called <em>tatsutaage</em>, where pieces of chicken are first marinated in a mixture of sake, soy sauce, and sugar which are then lightly covered with arrowroot starch and deep-fried. This method makes the meat succulent on the inside and particularly crispy on the outside. If not specified otherwise, karaage usually refers to fried chicken, but apart from chicken, the technique is sometimes used with other ingredients such as <em>askarei</em> (flounder), <em>ika</em> (bits of squid), and <em>gobo</em> (burdock root). Japanese karaage dishes are usually seasoned with garlic and ginger, and served with soy sauce on the side. They are a staple of informal Japanese gastropubs called <em>izakayas</em>, casual places for after-work drinks and snacks, but they are also available freshly fried as take-out food in numerous supermarkets and convenience stores.</p>",

Finally, the sushi roll is sliced into six to eight pieces, creating a bite-sized delicacy with an intricate and decorative appearance. The whole makizushi group consists of numerous different sushi types such as <em>futomaki, hosomaki, chumaki, uramaki,</em> and <em>temaki</em>. They usually employ the same ingredients, but differ in size, composition, and shape. Hosomaki is the smallest in size, while uramaki uses the different order of elements, placing the nori inside the rice. Traditional accompaniments to sushi are pickled ginger - used to clear the palate before each bite, wasabi - Japanese horseradish, and shoyu - the traditional Japanese soy sauce. Even though it is rather easily prepared at home and commonly found pre-packed in numerous stores around the world, it is best enjoyed freshly prepared by a sushi master in traditional Japanese restaurants, followed by <em>sake </em>- the authentic Japanese rice wine.</p>",

The metal grill is a part of traditional asado barbecues. It comes in many shapes and sizes, but it typically consists of a main grill with a firebox (called <em>brasero</em>) on the side. Firewood or charcoal are loaded into the firebox, and once the embers drop to the bottom, the coals are placed under the main grill. The plate is often tilted on a decline so that the excess juices can drip downward in order not to cause any flare-ups. Parrillas can be found in numerous homes and restaurants in Argentina, and the meat grilled on it typically includes chitterlings, morcilla blood sausages, chorizo sausages, salchichas parrilleras, ribs, sirloin, skirt steaks, and tenderloin.</p>",

As a result, Japanese curry is similar to the English curry, characterized by the heavy use of curry powder. The dish developed into curry rice, a rich stew of meat and vegetables (such as carrots, onions, and potatoes) which is ladled over short-grain, white rice. Common garnishes include eggplant, lotus root, and cucumbers on top. There is also a popular variation on kare raisu called <em>katsu kare</em>, a curry rice dish with a piece of deep-fried pork cutlet called <em>tonkatsu</em> placed on top.</p>",

    "Description":"<p>One of the very bases of traditional Italian cuisine, minestrone is a thick, chunky soup made with whichever vegetables are in season. Historically, being a poor man's food dating as far back as the year 30 CE, this peasant-style soup was made with a mashed bean or spelt base and leftovers from various <em>contorni </em>(side dishes) and other meals. Today, even though there's not a set recipe for this dish and every region has its own version, the most common ingredients include stock, onions, tomatoes, celery, carrots, and legumes. The vegetables are cut-up and simmered for quite a long time, but they must not turn mushy. Lastly, pasta or rice can be added to round-up this inexpensive, yet filling dish. Depending on the method of cooking, these flavorful soups are divided into two main categories: <em>minestrone a crudo</em> and <em>minestrone col soffritto</em>. While the first version uses raw vegetables and often garlic-flavored olive oil added towards the end of cooking, minestrone col soffritto is made with vegetables which are first saut&eacute;ed in butter, oil, pork fat or lard, together with pancetta (bacon) and pork rind. The perfect comfort food to warm a cold day, minestrone is even better when made in advance and served reheated, as it takes some time for the flavors to fuse and deepen.</p>",

Meringue is incredibly versatile and it is mostly prepared to turn desserts into works of art: it can be whipped into frostings for cakes, spooned on pies, incorporated into cakes to make them fluffy, or mixed with chocolate, fruits, and ground nuts for extra flavor. The origins of meringue are still somewhat shrouded in mystery, but the <em>Larousse Gastronomique</em> claims it was either invented by a Swiss pastry chef with Italian origins, named Gasparini, or by King Stanislas I Leszcynski's chef, because some believe that the word <em>meringue</em> comes from the Polish word <em>marzynka</em>. There are also other sources claiming that meringue is an English invention. Regardless of the origins, most food historians agree on the fact that meringue was shaped with a spoon until the early 19th century, and the famous French chef Antoine Car&ecirc;me first started using a pastry bag in order to form this decadent dessert into a more aesthetically pleasing shape. Meringue can be consumed in its soft or hard form, and is usually prepared using French, Italian, or Swiss methods, which all differ from one another. These three methods gave life to a wide variety of popular desserts, including the beloved <em>meringue cake</em>.</p>",

    "Description":"<p>These decadent, crispy fried pastry tubes filled with luscious ricotta cheese cream are perhaps one of Sicily's best known desserts outside of Italy. Cannoli are believed to have originated around Palermo during the 9th century, while Sicily was under Arab rule. Legend has it that they were originally prepared by the women of the ancient city of Qal'at al-Nis??' (lit. castle of women), the modern-day Caltanissetta, which at the time served as the harem of a Saracen emir. Later on, the recipe later somehow found its way to the monasteries of Palermo where nuns would prepare this lavish dessert during the carnival season. Cannoli have come a long way since then, becoming incredibly popular not only throughout Italy, but also in North America, where they were introduced by Sicilian immigrants in the late 19th century. Furthermore, thanks to one of the most famous lines from the movie The Godfather &mdash; \"Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.\" &mdash; by the end of the 1970s, this dessert had attained a truly iconic status. Although people in the United States are familiar with different variations of this classic recipe, cannoli in Sicily are still prepared in a more traditional way. The crispy pastry shells are typically flavored with cocoa, suet, and Marsala wine, while the delicate freshness of the sweetened ricotta is sometimes enriched with orange blossom water, candied orange peel, chocolate, zuccata candied pumpkin, or finely chopped pistachios. The name is derived from <em>canna</em>, a cane reed that&rsquo;s cut into sections and used as a mold for frying the pastry shells, although metal cylinders have mostly replaced canna nowadays. And last, but certainly not least, cannoli shells are always filled just before serving to prevent them from getting soggy, ensuring the perfect feel of crunchiness against the creamy filling.</p>",

    "Name":"Meatloaf",
    "Description":"<p>The ubiquitous meatloaf is a dish celebrated for its simplicity and versatility. It is made with a substantial amount of minced meat, most commonly pork and beef that is bound by eggs or dairy products. Typically, it is placed in a special mold or formed by hand in the popular shape of a log. After it has been baked, it is usually sliced and served with mashed potatoes or vegetables, all doused in the accompanying juicy sauce. Meatloaf is not a dish that is commonly found in high-end restaurants, nor does it belong to haute cuisine. It is rustic and ordinary, yet incredibly comforting and nutritious. The history of the meatloaf as we know it today is believed to have its origins in ancient Rome, where a gastronome named Apicius first mentioned the idea of minced meat patties. It is believed that the now traditional loaf-shaped form grew out of the necessity to hasten the process and save time. Later, to stretch the costly meat, additional ingredients such as breadcrumbs, oats, panko crumbs, and even vegetables were incorporated into the dish. Modern meatloaf is usually associated with the United States. The popular belief is that the American meatloaf was invented and became famous during the Great Depression Era in the 1930s, but the most probable version claims it was a brought over by numerous immigrants who flocked to the United States from Europe. The reinvention in the United States has coincided with the technical advancements, and the first time meatloaf was mentioned in print was in 1899, near the same time during the invention of mechanical meat grinders. Today, it is hard to find a country which does not have their variety of this classic. They might vary in the choice of meat, selection of spices, and favorite additional ingredients, but essentially all the various national meatloaf types are interpreted as comforting and economical family meals.</p>",

    "Description":"<p>There is nothing better to represent a true taste of New Orleans than gumbo, a filling soup that is usually prepared in large, black, iron pots. A cultural and gastronomical symbol of Louisiana, it can be based on seafood and okra with tomatoes, or on turkey and chicken with added ham, sausage, and poached oysters. Perhaps rabbit or a wild duck will be the main stars, accentuated in flavor by tasso ham. Regardless of its base, gumbo is always intensely fragrant and aromatic with onions, garlic, bay leaf, and thyme, its thick and rich liquids ladled into bowls with an accompaniment of steamed white rice. Gumbo evolved from the French <em>pot-au-feu</em>, when the slaves from West Africa added okra as a thickener to the already roux-thickened French stew. If okra was not in season, <em>fil&eacute;</em> powder was added, made from dried and crushed sassafras leaves, giving the dish a new layer of viscosity and a unique flavor. Whatever its variety of ingredients may be, gumbo must always include rice, roux (a combination of fat and browned flour that changes the flavor and modifies the thickness), and another thickener, be it okra or fil&eacute; powder, but never both at the same time. Fil&eacute; is typically used in thicker gumbos with sausages and chicken, while okra is used in lighter gumbos with seafood. Finally, a note for all gumbos - the ones that taste the best are those which had been left for a day or two and were then reheated, giving the ingredients a chance to combine into a flavorful and complex dish.</p>",

When feta cheese is present in the salad, it is usually just sliced, but in some cases it's mixed in with a fork until slightly crumbled. Its name suggests that it was a rural dish, when farmers would take some essential ingredients to the field and mix them together. Greek salad is a true summer dish, full of refreshing, raw vegetables and herbs. It is best to prepare it with ripe tomatoes that are in season, while the olives should be of the <em>Kalamata</em> variety. Served in a shallow bowl, it is present on numerous Greek tables, either at home or in the taverns.</p>",

The potatoes are more coarsely cut than regular fries, and they are sometimes even fried twice so that the exterior remains crispy while the interior remains soft, whereas the cheese does not melt but just softens, adding that special squeakiness to the dish, and the gravy is made with either beef or chicken stock with the addition of vinegar. Since its rise to stardom from the 1950s onwards, poutine has spread all over Canada and became popular in many parts of the USA where it's considered the ultimate late-night snack. It is found anywhere from food trucks to fancy restaurants, and even at Canadian McDonald's. Poutine connoisseurs claim that the best versions are served at small roadside stands where the curds are fresh, rubbery, and melt easily. Interestingly, in 2007, poutine was placed at number 10 of an online survey about the greatest Canadian inventions, conducted by <em>CBC</em>.</p>",

It could also be a reference to the popular French cheese called <em>Brie</em>, which is believed to have been one of the ingredients in the original brioche. A famine in the 18th century made bread expensive, so brioche became a status symbol &ndash; the amount of butter in your brioche was proportional to your prosperity.

    "Description":"<p>In Japanese cuisine, the term <em>agemono</em> refers to any kind of deep-fried dishes, and includes the three basic frying techniques: <em>suage</em>, in which the foods are fried without a coating of flour or batter; <em>karaage</em>, a method where food is first coated in flour or arrowroot starch which preserves its natural water content and produces a crispy outer surface; and <em>koromo-age</em>, in which foods are coated in batter before frying, just like tempura dishes. While koromo-age is most appropriate for seasonal fish, seafood and vegetables; suage technique is mostly used for frying freshwater fish, eggplant, green peppers and other vegetables whose color, texture and shape can be utilized to good effect. Lastly, karaage is typically used for meat, most often chicken, and includes a variant called <em>tatsutaage</em>, where pieces of chicken are first marinated in a mixture of sake, soy sauce and sugar, lightly covered with arrowroot starch and then deep-fried. Also, there is the so-called <em>furai</em> or <em>kawari-age</em> (lit. different deep-frying), a relatively novel technique which came from the West - it refers to breaded and deep-fried foods. Agemono dishes are traditionally prepared in the so-called <em>agemono nabe</em>, a thick-bottomed pot made from either cast iron or heavy brass which ensures an even temperature of the oil during frying. Agemono nabe is usually used in combination with metal-ended <em>saibashi</em> chopsticks, a net ladle or scoop called <em>ami shakushi</em>, and <em>abura kiri</em>, a special tool used to drain the excess oil after frying.</p>\n",

Made with thick dough or thin batter, the cakes are baked in a specially designed waffle iron which creates an unusual checkered pattern on the top and bottom of each cake. In Belgium, there are two distinct varieties of this national dessert: the light Brussels waffle, and the denser Liege waffle. The key distinction is in the batter: while the Brussels waffle batter is thin and runny, the Liege variety is made with a thick, brioche-like dough which produces a cake with uneven edges and dense texture. However, this distinction is only recognized in Belgium, while everywhere else in the world, this popular dessert is known simply as <em>the Belgian waffle</em>. Even though waffles have been present in Belgian cuisine since the Middle Ages, and were initially made with a mixture of barley and oats, they were made famous at World&rsquo;s Fair, held in New York in 1964. Maurice Vermersch, the innovator of the modern waffle version, decided to offer the waffles to American citizens, which proved to be a big hit. Since then, waffles have become a common breakfast staple in traditional American diners. However, in Belgium, waffles are regarded as street food - they are almost always eaten by hand, on-the-go. They are usually served plain or dusted with powdered sugar, but modern versions may be topped with anything from whipped cream and chocolate to caramel or sliced fruits.</p>",

    "Name":"Sweet and Sour Sauce",
    "Description":"<p>Sweet and sour sauce is usually associated with the authentic Chinese combination of rice vinegar and sugar. The probable origin of this sweet and sour mixture is the Chinese province of Hunan, where it was originally used as a condiment or a sauce for fish, meat, and vegetables. Some theories claim that the Chinese province of Guangdong was the place where this traditional sauce first appeared, but it is also possible that both sauces were developed independently at the same time in different provinces. The primary form had a pale yellow color, it was usually uncooked and served on the side as a dipping sauce. In some eastern Chinese provinces fruits such as pears and pineapples were used to create different flavor combinations. Later, the addition of various sauces, primarily soy and Worcestershire sauce, and different ingredients such as brown sugar, molasses, and honey, enabled the creation of numerous flavor varieties. The western versions usually add ketchup, which contributes to the distinctive red color of the sauce. In China, sweet and sour sauce is mostly used for dipping and is usually incorporated in stir-fries. The sauce is highly versatile, and can act as an accompaniment to seafood, meat, and even vegetable dishes. In the United States and Europe, it has become one of the most popular condiments and sauces, which has surpassed its original purposes, and is now commonly served in fast food chains and restaurants. This flavorful sauce is easily prepared at home, but can also be found in every better-equipped supermarket in China, Europe, and North America.</p>",

The baguette was brought over to Vietnam during the colonial period, and nowadays it is one of the few happy legacies from the time. The crusty bread, condiments, and meats are all a legacy of French and Chinese colonialism, while cilantro, chili, and pickles reflect the Vietnamese taste for fresh vegetables and bright flavors. In the beginning, most banh mi sandwiches consisted of bread, meat, and seasonings, with no added vegetables. Today, the possibilities are virtually limitless - the sandwiches are stuffed with cold cuts, French butter, fresh mayonnaise, liver p&acirc;t&eacute;, cucumbers, cilantro, pickles, oyster sauce, garlic...and the list goes on. The bread should be light, with a delicate crust and a tender, chewy, and soft interior with a slightly sweet flavor. The meat on the inside can be chicken, pork, beef, seafood, cold cuts, or p&acirc;t&eacute;s, sausages, and terrines, but it is extremely important not to overstuff the sandwich. Most of the fillings and condiments are things that foreigners are unfamiliar with, and that just may be the secret to its popularity. With their cult-like following and savory Vietnamese fillings, these sandwiches have crossed the borders of their native country long ago, and banh mi shops are still popping up all over the world.</p>",

    "Description":"<p>The remarkable baklava is a luscious dessert created with layers of thin phyllo dough intertwined with chopped nuts, all doused in a sweet, viscous syrup. The popularity of baklava has long surpassed borders, regions, and ethnic groups to become a dessert whose origin and invention is claimed by numerous countries. It is probable that it has an Assyrian origin, dating back to the 8th century, from where it spread out throughout the region all the way to Greece. The Greeks altered the recipe and created the thin sheets, known today as phyllo dough, but modern-day baklava is believed to be an original Turkish creation. However, it is almost impossible to pinpoint baklava's exact place of origin, and the debate about its authenticity is still going on between Turkey and Greece. Traditionally, baklava is made with sheets of paper-thin pastry at the bottom, followed by chopped nuts which are then topped with additional pastry layers. The other traditional way suggests alternating layers of phyllo dough with layers of chopped nuts. The original and authentic baklava should always have a nut-based filling, most commonly walnuts, hazelnuts, or pistachios, but modern versions have introduced unusual fillings such as apricots, chocolate, and even ground cookies. The dessert is typically prepared in large trays, and it is then sliced into squares, triangles, or diamond shapes before being doused in a luscious syrup made with water and sugar or honey. Very often, the syrup is flavored with sliced lemon, rose water, cinnamon, or cardamom. It is supposed to cover the entire tray and keep the delicate pastry succulent, creating a sweet and juicy cover around it. Iranian or Persian baklava differentiates itself because it is drier and lighter than other regional varieties, and it is often flavored with rose water. Even though it was once regarded as a decadent treat that was mostly enjoyed by the aristocracy, the famous baklava is now a traditional pastry and a dessert offered in numerous Oriental, Turkish, or Greek restaurants. It is also often found in pastry shops across the Balkan region all the way to the Middle East.</p>",

Today, gratin commonly refers to any dish with a crispy baked topping. The ingredients for gratin most often include cream, grated cheese, and breadcrumbs, or a combination of the three. In addition to baking the dish uncovered in a hot oven, the au gratin effect can also be achieved by quickly browning of the top of a prepared dish under a broiler, giving it a nice crispy crust. The technique is thought to have originated in Provence, but nowadays it is popular throughout the world. In addition to the famed <em>potatoes &agrave; la Dauphinoise</em>, gratin is a technique widely used in the preparation of various other vegetable-based dishes, as well as numerous meat, fish, and pasta casseroles.</p>",

The dish consists of chicken meat that is marinated in yogurt, seasoned with tandoori masala, nutmeg, and cumin, then placed on skewers. It is a unique dish because of the way it is prepared - traditionally, it is cooked at high temperatures in cylindrical clay ovens called <em>tandoor</em>, resulting in succulent meat with a smokey flavor. One popular theory suggests that it was invented by a man named Kundan Lal Gujral in his restaurant <em>Moti Mahal</em> (Palace of Pearls). He wanted to make a new dish, so he tried cooking the chicken in the tandoor, which was mostly used for baking the famous Indian bread called naan. The dish was an instant hit with the hungry customers, and the crispy, yet succulent chicken dish even caught the attention of Indian Prime Minister Jawaharial Nehru, who often ate at the restaurant and made it a regular dish at official banquets. The aforementioned theory belongs to the recent past, but historians claim that tandoor-cooked chicken actually dates back to the Mughal period, when the dish was merely a part of gigantic Indian feasts at the time. Tandoori chicken's fame led to many derivatives such as <em>chicken tikka masala</em> and <em>butter chicken</em>, both of them commonly found in restaurants across the country.</p>",

However, there is a heated debate considering secondary ingredients, primarily the tomatoes. Purists adore the original dish, made without tomatoes, known as <em>bianco</em> version, while the others prefer a version with crushed tomatoes, or a version with a tomato sauce, known as <em>spaghetti alle vongole con la salsa di pomodoro</em>. Similar issues arise regarding the addition or omission of peperoncino and pepper in the dish. Regardless of these issues, everyone agrees that the pasta should be cooked <em>al dente</em>. Although the dish is best in the summer, when all of the ingredients are as fresh as they might be, it is also one of the most important meals of the traditional Neapolitan Christmas Eve dinner, known as Cena della vigilia di Natale<em>.</em></p>",

Since the combination of meat and cheese is not kosher, it is unusual to know that the sandwich was invented in a Jewish deli. However, it is part of the Jewish culture in North America and it can, of course, be enjoyed by those who are not Orthodox Jews.

The dish is consumed throughout the country, and every family in Brazil has their own, special recipe. Saut&eacute;ed greens, cheese rolls, rice, and fresh, sliced oranges are served as an accompaniment to the smoked pork and richly flavored black beans. Traditionally, it is prepared for Saturday lunch, so that the consumers may sleep it off. The beans are flavored with onions, tomatoes, coriander, and garlic, while pork meat can be additionally enriched with dried beef and smoked pork sausages. Before the main meal, consumers are offered <em>caldinho de feijao</em>, a bean broth served in shot glasses or small ceramic cups and garnished with pork rinds known as <em>torresmos</em>. The name <em>feijoada</em> is derived from the Portuguese word for beans, <em>feij&atilde;o</em>, and it probably originated in the 1600s in Recife, on sugar plantations built by the Portuguese colonists, although some believe that it was created in Rio de Janeiro. The Brazilian version usually uses black beans, while the Portuguese one typically uses white or kidney beans. Feijoada is artfully displayed on platters full of ingredients, so that the consumers may choose their favorites and enjoy them at a leisurely pace. The meats are sliced and placed on platters; the beans served in large serving bowls, and the accompaniments include Brazilian rice, kale, cassava with butter or hard-boiled eggs, sliced oranges, and hot pepper-lime sauce. During the meal, <em>cachaca</em>, a sugarcane brandy and Brazil's most popular liquor, is served as a traditional accompaniment to feijoada.</p>",

Pot pie is characterized by its top crust, which is traditionally made with flaky pastry. The ancient custom of pot pie was revived in 16th-century England, when cooks used to make meat pies with tiny, gooseberry-stuffed birds on the inside. The popularity of pot pies soon spread to other countries, so in the 19th century, Americans became obsessed with a pot pie that featured robins in it. Today, pot pie variations with chicken and other meats are an American tradition and comfort food of the first order that even has its own day, known as the <em>National Great American Pot Pie Day</em>, celebrated annually on September 23rd.</p>",

Contrary to popular belief, parmigiana has nothing to do with parmigiano Reggiano cheese, even though it is used in many recipes as it makes for a crunchier crust. Nor, in fact, does it have any connection with the city of Parma whatsoever. In fact, the name of this scrumptious summer dish supposedly stems from parmisciana, the word for &ldquo;Persian&rdquo; in the Sicilian dialect, and it is often suggested that the word is rooted in the Arabic badhnajan or Turkish patl??can, both of which mean &ldquo;eggplant&rdquo;. Although the eggplant was introduced to Italy by the Arabs as early as the 8th century, the parmigiana we know today may have originated in Sicily at around the 16th century, when tomatoes were first brought to Italy from the New World by the Spaniards. Later, the eggplant casserole spread across the country, taking on a version of its own in each region. Regardless of its true origins and the many different takes on the classic recipe, parmigiana di melanzane remains Southern Italian comfort food at its best, and is one of the most popular Italian dishes today.</p>",

Similar to paella, pilaf, or risotto, its key ingredients are rice, shrimp or crab meat, finely cut, spicy, smoked sausage and smoked ham, diced green peppers, garlic, celery, onions, tomatoes, and the obligatory spices - thyme and bay leaves. In some instances, chicken is added to the dish, but today there are also numerous variations from turkey shrimp to alligator meat additions. Rice is added in the end, to absorb the rich flavors from the stock until there is no liquid left. It is cooked in a big, heavy pot and is known to be a crowd-pleaser, so it is not a surprise that it is the most popular dish on the Gulf of Mexico oil rigs, where the employees share a similar food culture.</p>",

Nimono is also the principal way of preparing and serving vegetables as well as one of the most popular ways of preparing fish. Before simmering, base ingredients such as various vegetables, fish, seafood, or tofu are usually blanched or parboiled in water, and then cooked in <em>shiru</em> stock over a long period of time, until the liquid is almost fully absorbed or evaporated. The shiru stock used for nimono is most often <em>dashi</em>, which can be slightly sweetened and flavored with sake and soy sauce, mirin, vinegar, miso, or other condiments. Depending on the combination of seasoning and the type of stock, there are several varieties of nimono dishes. <em>Misoni</em> or <em>misodaki</em> are typically used for fish or sometimes vegetables; simmered in a mixture of miso and dashi, flavored with soy sauce and freshly chopped ginger. <em>Nitsuke</em> is mainly used for simmering fish in a mixture of sake, soy sauce, and mirin or sugar. <em>Shigureni</em> refers to dishes simmered in dashi which was heavily seasoned with soy sauce, while <em>karani</em> uses only sake and soy sauce for simmering. Some of the most famous nimono dishes include <em>nizakana</em> or <em>nitsuke </em>- fish poached in sweetened dashi, sometimes with the addition of miso; <em>kakuni</em> - chunks of pork belly stewed in soy, mirin, and sake with large pieces of daikon and whole boiled eggs; and <em>oden</em> - a classic Japanese winter dish consisting of boiled eggs, daikon radish, konjac root, and fishcakes stewed in a savory, soy-flavored dashi broth.</p>",

A myriad of ingredients, meat, seafood, vegetables, and noodles, are placed on the table and subsequently placed in the pot. When cooked, guests fill their individual bowls with broth and other ingredients. When the first pot is finished, the other is filled, until all ingredients are used. Usually, a bowl of ponzu sauce is placed on the table for dipping. Nabemono also includes dishes such as <em>yudofu</em>, when only the soft and silky tofu is placed in the bowl, and <em>motsunabe</em>, in which animal offal is cooked in the fragrant broth. This classic Japanese technique is found in most traditional restaurants, where it is usually served during cold winter months.</p>",

    "Name":"Tajine",
    "Description":"<p>Tajine, also known as <em>tagine</em>, refers both to the rich Moroccan stews and the cooking vessel used to make them. When referring to the cooking vessel, it is a round and shallow, clay or ceramic casserole with a tall, pointy, conical lid. The same lid fits into the base, so the steam condenses on its interior and drops back into the stew without any waste of flavors and moisture. The pots are ideal for slow cooking over embers or on a stove, resulting in buttery, tender vegetables and meat that falls off the bone. Tajines can be glazed or unglazed - the unglazed ones are earthier and darken over time, while the glazed ones are recommended for people who cook infrequently. There are also <em>serving tajines</em>, which are usually decorated and lighter than the other tajines, but they're not resistant to heat. In the area of Rif Mountains, there's tagra, an unglazed tajine with little clay handles and without a lid. A Berber tajine is known as <em>chalhaoui</em>, and it has a rounded, dome-shaped lid instead of the conical one. Tajines show Moroccan cuisine's affinity for combining different textures and mixing flavors, such as a well-balanced blend of savory and sweet, for example, chicken with tomato and almonds, and veal cuts with stewed, sliced pears. Baby artichokes, spring peas, and various nuts such as almonds or pistachios are a common ingredient in tajines. These dishes are often accompanied by couscous, steamed rice, or fresh, hot bread, and the varieties are virtually limitless &ndash; from seafood tajines with mussels and tomato sauce, to lamb tajines with vegetables such as onions, carrots, potatoes, and olives, fruits such as apricots and raisins, and lots of spices such as red and black pepper, cumin, saffron, and turmeric, tajines are a national dish full of creativity and flavour.</p>",

It is often compared to <em>Indian curry</em> because of its consistency and unique flavors. The theory about how rendang was invented claims that the generous use of spices and long cooking hours were employed to preserve the meat in hot and tropical climates, such as Indonesian, so unsurprisingly, the need to preserve meat for a longer period appeared among the Minangkabau people. They were mainly traders who underwent long journeys and needed food which could stay fresh for weeks. However, the dish has a more symbolic meaning to them, because the main four ingredients used in rendang represent the Minangkabau society: the meat symbolizes leaders, coconut is a symbol of intellectuals, chili represents religious leadership, and other spices signify the rest of society. Today, rendang has surpassed Indonesian borders and has a reputation as one of the most delicious dishes in the world.</p>",

Today, numerous restaurants claim that they invented the onion rings, one of them being <em>Pig Stand</em> from Oak Cliff, Texas. Regardless of the inventor, there is a large variety of onion rings today, such as <em>beer batter onion rings</em>, <em>blooming onion rings</em> (using whole onions), and <em>kanda bhajiya</em>, a fritter with gram flour batter.

Although the inventor of the sauce remains unknown, some claim that hollandaise was originally invented in the Netherlands before being brought to France by the Huguenots. Other food historians claim that it was originally called Isigny, a sauce that was especially popular in Normandy, but that the name changed during World War I due to the fact that butter was scarce and had to be imported into France from the Netherlands. The earliest mention of the sauce is found in a 1593 Dutch cookbook, and Pierre La Varenne described a similar sauce in his 1651 cookbook Le Cuisinier fran&ccedil;ois. Hollandaise sauce is most commonly used to season fish and steamed vegetables such as asparagus.

Some claim it was invented at Pizzeria <em>Port'Alba</em> in 1734, considered the oldest pizzeria in the world. Marinara is a part of protected Napoletana pizzas, with specific rules concerning the production process, the dough, and the key ingredients used in making the pizza.</p>",

    "Name":"Sachertorte",
    "Description":"<p>The original Sachertorte is the most famous Austrian cake. It is a classic, layered chocolate sponge cake that is thinly coated with high-quality apricot jam and topped with chocolate icing. Sachertorte is said to taste the best when accompanied by a small cloud of unsweetened whipped cream on the side. It was invented in 1832 by Franz Sacher, a pastry chef for Prince Clemens Lothar Wensel Metternich, the State Chancellor of Austria at the time. The prince wanted a new cake, and Sacher, 16 years old at the time, obliged him by creating something new from ingredients that were readily available in the kitchen. Suffice to say, the cake was a huge hit, and Franz's son Eduard opened a hotel called <em>Sacher</em> in 1876, serving the popular cake up to this day. Today, almost every coffee house in Vienna has its own version of the cake, but no two cakes are quite alike. In order to avoid confusion, it is recommended to look for the official Sacher chocolate seal on top of the cake, which can only be found on the Original Sacher, produced by Hotel Sacher in a quantity of approximately 360,000 cakes per year. Interestingly, from 1954 to 1963, Hotel Sacher went through a legal battle with their rival, Demel cafe, and the court proceedings focused on which one had the right to call its Sachertorte the original. The issues that were discussed included whether the cake should have an additional layer of apricot jam in the middle, and whether to use margarine or butter. Following a long seven-year dispute, the parties have reached an agreement&mdash;and the original Sacher torte is now only found at the Hotel Sacher. Nevertheless, Demel version, which does not have the additional layer of apricot jam in the middle, is almost equally popular.</p>\n",

    "Name":"Bratwurst",
    "Description":"<p>What was once an item for survival during the cold winter months and a technique of not wasting meat scraps is nowadays a delicacy consumed throughout Germany and abroad. Bratwurst stems from two words, an Old High German word <em>brat</em>, meaning <em>meat without waste</em>, and <em>wurst</em>, which means<em> sausage</em>. Bratwurst has origins with the Celtics, but the Franconians developed it further. It dates back to the 1300s in a region that would eventually become Eastern Germany. Bratwurst is usually consumed for breakfast, due to the tradition of farmers who would make the sausages in the morning and eat them by noon, as they would otherwise spoil. Technically, a bratwurst must be made from either pork, veal, or beef, but there are more than 40 varieties of the sausage throughout Germany. The oldest recipe for bratwurst was discovered in 2000 by a historian named Heinrich H&ouml;llerlhas. The same recipe, for the <em>Thuringian bratwurst</em> (one of the most famous varieties), says that the makers had to use only the purest, unspoiled meat in the production process. Today, bratwursts are commonly served with sauerkraut, potato salad, horseradish, or mustard in Germany, but the sausages are also popular in the United States, especially in Wisconsin, where they are commonly found at summer cookouts and barbecues.</p>",

Due to the usage of peanut sauce, karedok is often compared with another Indonesian specialty, <em>gado-gado</em>, but it is still distinguished by the usage of only raw ingredients. Karedok originated in West Java and is traditionally associated with the Sundanese ethnic group. In Indonesia, karedok can be found at food stalls, traditional hawker-style food courts, and restaurants.

Ketupat can be found in many Asian countries, but its origin is usually associated with the Indonesian island of Java. Ketupat is particularly important during the Eid festival in the Muslim community. It also holds a strong religious symbolism, according to which the intricately woven leaves represent the mistakes caused by human nature, and the white rice inside stands for innocence, purity, and the final deliverance of sins.

These pickles of various colors and shapes are made from many different preserved fruits and vegetables; the most popular include daikon radish, aubergine, cucumbers, sour plums, turnips, carrots, gobo root, nappa cabbage, ginger, and shiso buds. Even though they can easily be prepared at home, Japanese pickles are available for purchase in most Asian grocery stores, and depending on the type of preservation, tsukemono comes in countless varieties and regional specialties. Some of the most popular are salt-pickled <em>shiozuke</em>, the simplest and easiest tsukemono to prepare; <em>suzuke</em> pickles brined in Japanese rice vinegar; the sweet and salty <em>shoyuzuke</em> tsukemono pickled in soy sauce which is usually combined with vinegar and sugar; and <em>misozuke</em> pickles cultured in miso paste seasoned with mirin, garlic, and ginger.

Apart from providing nutritional and health benefits of lactic-acid fermentation, the tangy bits of tsukemono serve an important purpose of cleansing the palate during a meal, lend refreshing tartness to counter the heaviness of umami-rich foods, and bring color, texture, and fragrance to a meal, which is why tsukemono is sometimes also called <em>konomono</em> (lit. fragrant things).</p>",

If you want to taste an authentic croque, the cheese must be Gruyere (mixed with bechamel in order to get Mornay sauce) and the whole sandwich needs to be saut&eacute;ed in butter until it is crispy and golden brown. The croque-monsieur is so popular that the famous novelist Proust even wrote about it in his 1918 masterpiece <em>In Search of Lost Time</em>. According to food historians, the sandwich was originally named by Michel Lunarca, the owner of a popular bistro on the Boulevard des Capucines in the early 20th-century Paris. Frustrated by his success, Lunarca's competitors began spreading rumors that he was a cannibal. When he ran out of baguettes for sandwiches one day, he used a loaf of <em>pain de mie</em> to make a toasted sandwich with cheese and bread. Upon being asked by a guest what kind of meat he used for the sandwich, he replied \"Le viande de monsieur, &eacute;videmment.\"&mdash;meaning&mdash;\"Human meat, obviously.\" The joke made these sandwiches an instant hit, and he put them on the menu under the name they are known by today. For those who think everything tastes better with eggs, there is the <em>croque-madame</em>, a popular version of croque-monsieur topped with a fried egg, which, according to some people, represents a woman's hat.</p>",

The batter is the most crucial part of tempura, consisting of flour, eggs, and water, keeping the ingredients moist and flavorful. Even though the dish is very simple, it has quite murky origins. The most popular theory says that the Jesuit missionaries who came to Japan from Portugal in the 16th century were the most probable inspiration for the dish, consuming vegetable and seafood fritters on <em>ember days</em> (days on which no meat was allowed to be consumed). Another theory says that battered and deep-fried food was introduced to Japan by the Chinese, initially embraced by Zen priests who wanted to make their vegetarian diet more flavorful. Regardless of the origins of tempura, it remains an iconic dish that is served in a wide variety of ways: on its own, over rice, accompanied by <em>tentsuyu</em> or soy sauce, or even as a filling in sushi rolls.</p>",

The sweet treats were invented by Bekir Affendi, who came to Istanbul in 1777 from Anatolia. His first shop,<em> Haci Bekir</em>, is still in business, run by his descendants. The name of these sweets comes from the Arabic term<em> rahat-ul hulkum,</em> meaning <em>heal</em> or <em>soothe the throat</em>. Its other popular name, <em>Turkish delight,</em> was coined in the 18th century when an English traveler took some of the sweets back home, and since he couldn't pronounce the Arabic name, he coined his own term. The original recipe called for corn flour, refined beet sugar, honey, and water. The treat soon gained popularity, and today it is one of the most famous symbols of Turkey.</p>",

It is usually brushed with a mixture of ginger, oil, hoisin sauce, honey, and rice vinegar, then vertically hung and slowly roasted to perfection. When the dish is served, the skin will often come first as an appetizer, followed by the meat which is accompanied by cucumbers, scallions, hoisin sauce, buns, and pancakes.

Sauerkraut is also praised as being an excellent source of vitamins, along with being a flavorful comfort food consumed throughout Eastern Europe and abroad.</p>",

    "Description":"<p>Kaminari-okoshi, often called merely <em>okoshi</em>, is a popular Japanese confectionery, similar to rice crispy treats. The main ingredient in okoshi is expanded rice, created by roasting rice grains until they pop. A mix of sugar and butter or corn syrup is used to hold the rice together, and after the additional ingredients have been added, the mixture is formed or pressed in trays, left to dry, then cut into square shapes. This crispy Japanese treat first appeared during the mid-Edo period in Japan and was primarily sold by street vendors in the vicinity of Buddhist temples in Asakusa, one of the districts in Tokyo. Originally, peanuts were added to enrich okoshi, but modern versions also include other nuts, dried fruit, chocolate, or sesame seeds, along with other exotic and interesting flavors such as matcha green tea or caramel. Most okoshi is nowadays factory-produced, created in an array of unusual flavor and color combinations, and sold in decorative, colorful boxes. In the Asakusa area, there are still traditional street vendors who prepare this brittle snack and demonstrate the entire procedure. Okoshi is still the most famous souvenir of the Asakusa area.</p>",

This cut holds very little fat in the meat, so it must be cooked perfectly in order not to make it tough. In Brazil, every churrasco has picanha, and all of the best churrascarias feature picanha on their menus. The name <em>picanha</em> is derived from the word <em>picana</em>, referring to the <em>ranchers' pole</em> used for herding cattle in Portugal and Spain. The technique was brought over to Brazil where the word picanha was used to refer to the part of the cow that was poked by ranchers with the pole.</p>",

    "Description":"<p>Numerous tiny, light, tender grains, ideally arranged to form a pyramid and served on a platter at the end of a meal - that is couscous, the national dish of Morocco and a must-have dish in any Moroccan restaurant. The word itself refers both to the complete dish and the tiny grains of semolina. Semolina flour is sprinkled with water until it forms into tiny pellets that are then pushed through a sieve. Couscous is usually prepared on Fridays for lunch, when whole families get together for the most important meal of the week. The dish is traditionally made in a metal steamer pot called a <em>couscoussier</em>, where the stew is on the bottom, while the small grains are in the perforated basket on top, cooking in the steam that is rising from the rich stew. Although couscous dishes are often full of vegetables, they are rarely vegetarian. Some classics include <em>couscous with seven vegetables</em> and <em>couscous with raisins and caramelized onions</em>, but there are many more varieties such as <em>spicy</em> with chili peppers, <em>sweet</em> with chickpeas, lamb and raisins, <em>Berber-style</em> with chicken, milk and turnips, or <em>fish couscous</em> with fish, fennel stalks, and wild turnips. There is even a dessert couscous dish served with butter and enhanced with cinnamon and sugar. After couscous is served, it is covered with meat or fish and vegetables, while the broth from the same stew is served on the side, for the ones who want to ladle some on top of the grains. However, don't be mistaken - it is not the main course, as it is served at the end of a long string of courses to totally satiate the consumer, as the popular Arabian hospitality saying goes - \"No guest should go home hungry\".</p>",

Although Russian in origin, the dish is strongly influenced by the French style of cooking&mdash;this is most obviously seen in the way the beef is cut, in either cubes or strips. The first known recipe appeared in Elena Molokhovets&rsquo;s <em>A Gift to Young Housewives,</em> published in 1871. Since then, the dish has had major alterations. The beef is still cut in strips, but the sauce is much richer; with sliced mushrooms and onions that are cooked with beef stock and thickened a bit with sour cream that is only stirred in at the end. The dish is traditionally served with potato straws, but goes equally well with either rice pilav, egg noodles, or mashed potatoes.</p>",

The first recipe for Amatriciana was published in the 1790 cookbook<em> L&rsquo;Apicio Moderno</em> by Francesco Leonardi, a renowned Roman chef and author. Over time, this classic Italian dish became so popular it was featured in several movies, from Alberto Sordi&rsquo;s 1954 film <em>An American in Rome</em> and Luciano Salce&rsquo;s 1978 <em>Where Are You Going on Holiday?</em> to Ryan Murphy&rsquo;s <em>Eat Pray Love</em>, in which Julia Roberts joyfully wolfs down a portion of spaghetti all&rsquo;Amatriciana while sitting on the terrace of a typical Roman <em>osteria</em>. With delicate heat from pepperoncino peppers, the sweetness and tartness from the tomato-based sauce, the sharpness of pecorino, and the fatty richness of guanciale, Amatriciana is best enjoyed with medium-bodied, smooth Italian reds such as Montepulciano d&rsquo;Abruzzo and Sangiovese.</p>",

The crowd loved the dish, and it soon became a staple on the bar's menu, and why wouldn't it, with crispy skin on the outside, tender meat on the inside, and a special hot sauce infused with vinegar and butter, with celery sticks and blue cheese dressing providing a perfect opportunity to cool down the hotness of the wings. Today, buffalo wings can be found in every sports bar, at barbecues, and at almost every Super Bowl party in the USA.</p>",

    "Name":"Stollen",
    "Description":"<p>This rich fruit bread is one of German Christmas classics. Stollen is prepared with a buttery, sweet yeast dough that is usually spiced, lemon-flavored, and enriched with various dried fruits and marzipan. Though it may appear in different forms, it is usually oblong and covered with generous amounts of melted butter and powdered sugar. Among the different varieties, Dresdner stollen is considered as the oldest and the most popular version, whose origins are traced back to the 15th century. Originally, stollen was plain and prepared only with flour, yeast, and oil, and it was only in 1490, when the Pope Innocent VIII lifted the ban on baking with butter during Advent, that the stollen started to develop into a dense and rich cake that is known today.</p>",

    "Name":"Tikka",
    "Description":"<p>Indian <em>tikka</em> is a dish which consists of boneless meat, mostly chicken, that is cut into smaller pieces, and marinated in yogurt and traditional Indian spices such as turmeric, cumin, coriander, cayenne pepper, chili, garlic, and ginger. The meat is roasted over charcoal in a <em>tandoor</em>, the traditional cylindrical clay oven. To remain tender and juicy, the meat is repeatedly brushed with oil or butter. Tikka is typically cooked and served on sizzlers, but the plain varieties are also common. It is often wrongly associated with <em>tandoori chicken</em>, a variety baked and served with the meat left on the bone. Indian tikka has an unknown origin, but it is believed to be an ancient dish that has existed since the discovery of the tandoor oven, which has been used in India for more than 5000 years. Legend says that emperor Babur, the founder of the Mughal dynasty, requested Punjabi chefs to serve the traditional tandoori chicken without the bones, which led to the creation of the now famous chicken tikka. It is a popular dish in Pakistan and Afghanistan, where it is usually served as a chicken tikka sizzler. Mutton and lamb variations can occasionally be found, but chicken is still the most popular ingredient. Traditional chicken tikka should not be confused with the <em>chicken tikka masala</em>, a variation of the dish with origins in the United Kingdom. In chicken tikka masala the meat is served with tomato sauce and is considered to be a British national dish. Tikka is usually accompanied by onions, chopped coriander, vegetable chutney, and lemon slices.</p>",
