    "Name":"Dashi",
    "Description":"<p>One of the fundamental ingredients in Japanese cuisine, dashi is a type of soup and cooking stock often used as the base for different miso and noodle soups, <em>donburi</em> or rice bowl dishes, stews and many other kinds of <em>nimono</em> or simmered dishes. Dashi is typically made from <em>kombu</em> (dried kelp), <em>katsuobushi</em> (dried and smoked skipjack tuna), <em>iriko</em> or <em>niboshi</em> (anchovies or sardines), or a combination of these ingredients, all of which are naturally rich in glutamates and thus deliver an intense <em>umami</em> flavor to a number of Japanese dishes. There are several types of dashi and deciding on which kind of dashi to use for a particular dish depends solely on one's preference. <em>Awase dashi</em> is the most common all-purpose seafood-based stock made from a combination of kombu and bonito flakes. It is most often used for preparing dishes such as <em>miso soup</em>, <em>oyakodon</em>, <em>oden</em>, <em>nikujaga</em>, <em>chikuzenni</em>, <em>tamagoyaki</em>, etc. <em>Kombu dashi</em> is a vegetarian stock made exclusively with kombu; it has a mild flavor and goes well with either vegetable or fish-based dishes such as yudofu or clamp soup, as it doesn't overpower other flavors. <em>Iriko</em> or <em>niboshi dashi</em> is a seafood-based stock made from dried baby anchovies or sardines; it has a strong fishy aroma, but its flavor is not as strong. Compared to katsuobushi and kombu, this dashi is more affordable and most commonly used for making miso soup, noodle soup dishes like <em>curry udon</em> or <em>kitsune udon</em>, as well as various donburi and nimono dishes. <em>Shiitake dashi</em> is another vegetarian stock made by rehydrating dried shiitake mushrooms. It is rarely used on its own; instead, it is usually combined with other kinds of dashi to enhance the flavor and add umami to various noodle soups and simmered dishes.</p>",

    "Name":"Ceviche",
    "Description":"<p>Ceviche is the national dish of Peru consisting of slices of raw fish or shellfish that is spiced with salt, onions, and chili peppers, then marinated in lime juice. Due to the acidity of lime juice, the texture of the fish changes, as does its color &ndash; from pink to white. The acidic marinade, also known as<em> leche de tigre</em> (lit. tiger's milk) \"cooks\" the meat without any heat involved in the process. For ceviche, fresh fish is an imperative, as fish and shellfish that are not fresh can cause food poisoning. Peruvians are used to fresh ingredients, so the fish will sometimes be prepared for ceviche less than an hour after being caught. Fish for ceviche can be divided into three categories: firm, medium, and soft. The dish was originally made by the natives who marinated fish and <em>amarillo</em> chiles in the juices of a native fruit called <em>tumbo</em>, which was replaced by lime juice when the Spanish brought limes and onions to the country. The flavors of ceviche are slightly acidic and spicy, with an intense aroma of the sea. Traditionally, it is served on a bed of lettuce with tiny pieces of corn, chunks of sweet potato, and boiled yuca. <em>Cancha</em>, a variety of popcorn made from large corn kernels toasted in salt and oil provides an ideal side dish. The dish is traditionally served at <em>cevicherias</em>, specialized ceviche restaurants that can be found all over the country, and it is so popular that it even has its day, known as National Ceviche Day.</p>",

Carpaccio was created in 1950 by a Venetian restaurateur named Giuseppe Cipriani, the owner of <em>Harry&rsquo;s Bar</em>, who first made the dish for Countess Amalia Nani Mocenigo, whose doctors had recommended she eat raw meat. Cipriani based the dish on a specialty from Piedmont consisting of slices of raw beef dressed with lemon juice, olive oil, and white truffle shavings. An impassioned art lover, Cipriani named the new dish carpaccio in honor of painter Vittore Carpaccio, whose style and bold colors were reminiscent of the intense red color of raw meat. Today, there are numerous modern varieties of carpaccio made with zucchini, scallops, beet, salmon, figs, and lamb, and it is said that any kind of carpaccio is best paired with a glass of wine on the side.</p>",

    "Name":"Tataki",
    "Description":"<p>Tataki is the Japanese technique of preparing meat or fish, where the product is briefly seared and left raw in the middle. Most commonly, tuna steaks or beef tenderloin is employed in the tataki technique since perfect cuts allow equal searing on all sides. Meat or fish prepared tataki-style is primarily seared on all sides, then placed in an ice bath and left to chill.  It is then sliced into thin pieces and neatly arranged on a plate. Although it is often regarded as a unique technique, meat and fish products prepared in tataki-style are often served alongside other sashimi dishes. It is also commonly eaten as a single dish in traditional Japanese restaurants, where it is usually offered as an appetizer. When the meat or fish is arranged on a plate, the whole dish is usually doused in soy or ponzu sauce that is mixed with citrus juice and aromatized with grated ginger, onions, and sliced garlic. Sakamoto Ry??ma, a prominent figure in Japan in the 19th century, is believed to have invented this traditional Japanese technique in the ancient province of Tosa, which is now a part of K??chi Prefecture. The region is known for skipjack tuna (katsuo) tataki in which pieces of tuna are seared over an open flame. </p>",

In Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, and in a number of other South American countries, it is both a culinary and social event attended by friends and family to share the joy of outdoor cooking. Asado traditionally features a wide selection of grilled meats, mainly beef, which Argentina is most known for. The meat is cooked on a special brick-built grill called <em>la parrilla</em>, and the fire can either be made with charcoal (<em>parrilla al carb&oacute;n</em>) or wood (<em>parrilla a le&ntilde;a</em>) which is more typical for the countryside and known as <em>asado criollo</em>, a term that indicates a more rustic, traditional style of grilling. First to go on the grill are <em>chorizos</em> (pork sausages), <em>morcillas</em> (blood sausages), and <em>achuras</em> (offal), followed by thinner beef cuts such as <em>matambre</em> (rose) and <em>entra&ntilde;a</em> (skirt steak), which are to be grilled hot and fast, as they would otherwise dry out. As for all the other juicy asado meats, they are grilled to perfection over <em>fuego lento</em> or slow fire. Some of the most popular cuts include <em>bife de chorizo</em> (sirloin), <em>tira de asado</em> (beef chuck ribs, flanken-style), <em>bife ancho</em> (Argentine ribeye), <em>bife angosto</em> (striploin), <em>bife de costilla</em> (T-bone or porterhouse), <em>lomo</em> (tenderloin), <em>cuadril</em> (rump), and <em>vacio</em> (flank steak).

The word comes from the Dutch <em>bil</em>, meaning <em>hind quarter</em>, and <em>tong</em>, meaning <em>strip</em>, in this case - a strip of meat. Although it looks similar to American beef jerky, it is quite different in flavor and the method of preparation. The beef is dried with vinegar which cures the meat and adds layers of texture and flavor. It is seasoned with salt, pepper, and coriander, and the meat is much thicker than beef jerky. Originally, it was created out of necessity as a survival food when the Dutch settlers arrived in South Africa. As the climate was extremely hot, they needed to preserve the meat, so they hung it out to dry and found out that it had become hard on the exterior, yet flavorful on the inside. And so, biltong was born, enjoyed today both in South Africa and abroad as a testament to its ever-growing popularity.</p>",

Although traditionally associated with Naples, it is believed that the original sfogliatella was invented around 1700 on the Italian Amalfi Coast, as a creation of nuns from the Santa Rosa monastery. This version was filled with luscious custard cream and black cherries preserved in syrup, and although the nuns were forbidden to have contact with the external world, the recipe was somehow obtained by a Neapolitan chef who started preparing his variety of these delicious sweets which soon became a Naples favorite. Nowadays, they are offered in two main varieties: <em>riccia</em> and <em>frolla</em>. Sfogliatella riccia is regarded as the traditional and the most common variety. It is an elaborate dessert made with multiple layers of paper-thin dough arranged in a clam-shaped pocket, filled with a delicious cream made with semolina, water, ricotta, sugar, eggs, cubed candied fruit, cinnamon, and a pinch of salt. Sfogliatella frolla has the same filling, but it is round-shaped and made with shortcrust pastry. Another version of this dessert is <em>coda d&rsquo;aragosta</em>, literally meaning<em> lobster tail</em>, filled with pastry cream. It is a very popular dessert in the United States, with their version typically being much larger than the original. Traditionally, sfogliatella should always be served freshly prepared, while still crispy, preferably warm and dusted with powdered sugar.</p>",

Regardless of the cut, the meat is always simmered slowly with root vegetables. Some chicken pieces and a marrow bone may also be added to the mix, and the pot is constantly skimmed, resulting in a crystal clear broth. Traditionally, tafelspitz is eaten in separate courses: first comes the broth that's served hot in bouillon cups, followed by tender slices of beef which are usually accompanied by potatoes, carrots, and a creamy apple-horseradish and chive sauce.</p>",

When served in restaurants, the server will bring all the ingredients and cook the dish for the guests.

It is put on top of dak galbi and mixed until all the elements are completely coated in it. At the end of the meal, when there is still some food left in the skillet, a common tradition is for the server to add rice into the skillet and create an unusual variety of fried rice. Several vegetable side dishes are usually served alongside dak galbi, and lettuce or perilla leaves are occasionally used instead of utensils as crunchy wrappers. Dak galbi is now considered a Korean classic, but it originated as a frugal dish in the 1960s. Since then, it has spread from Chuncheon to other parts of South Korea.

Additionally, mozzarella or cheddar cheese can be added to the sandwich, according to personal preferences. There are three popular theories about the origin of the Italian beef sandwich. One says that is was invented by Al Ferreri (the owner of <em>Al's Beef</em> restaurant) and his family at the start of World War II. They invented it in response to big Italian weddings that needed to stretch a small amount of food a long way. Another theory says that the sandwich is a version of the <em>French dip</em>, introduced in Los Angeles in 1918. According to Pat Bruno, a critic for the <em>Chicago Sun-Times</em>, it was invented by a man named Tony who worked in a Greek diner and messed around with the French dip recipe, creating the Italian beef sandwich in the process. The third theory gives credit to Pasquale Scala, a supplier of Italian beef in Chicago, who invented it as a way to help consumers to stretch their dollar during the Great Depression. Regardless of the origin of the sandwich, it is still a staple of Chicago's cuisine, found at numerous restaurants and hot dog stands across the city.</p>",

When drinking beer, Koreans prefer to eat fried and heavy dishes such as fried chicken, sausages, french fries, or grilled meat and vegetables. A strong rice liquor known as <em>soju</em> is usually paired with robust and hearty dishes such as <em>jjigae</em> stews, spicy tofu, kimchi, Korean pancakes, stir-fried seafood dishes, or grilled pork belly. Other typical food items used as anju include nuts, dried fruits, and even whole plates of fresh fruit. Convenient options also include chips, dried fish, crackers, and occasionally even some sweet treats. Depending on the occasion, environment, and type of company, anju dishes can be served as a set of different dishes (usually in smaller portions), or as one large meal that is typically shared among a group of people. General guidelines of serving anju are very flexible, and the list of anju dishes is rather extensive. In traditional Korean bars, karaoke places, and clubs, it is usually a prerequisite to order anju with your drink.</p>",

Ptichye moloko was first made in 1978 by Vladimir Guralnik, who was the head patisserie chef at Moscow's prestigious Praga restaurant. And just like the popular milk-flavored, meringue-filled candy bar that inspired Guralnik to make the cake version, the Russian ptichye moloko (lit. bird's milk) got its whimsical name as a reference to an old idiom denoting \"something so exquisite, delicate and rare it probably doesn't even exist\". Interestingly, the name caught up immediately and also seemed quite fitting, as bird's milk cake was invented during the heyday of the USSR, rapidly gaining popularity of mass proportions among the Soviet consumers despite being expensive and relatively hard to purchase at the time. In the US, this cake is still popular among Russian immigrants who often use Cool Whip and gelatin to get the right consistency.</p>",

The first one typically uses smaller fish such as parrotfish or wreckfish, which are cut open, salted, and then allowed to dry in the sun for about four days, during which the fish acquire a distinctive, rich flavor and firm flesh. Typical of Fuerteventura and Lanzarote, the jareas are often roasted. The latter specialty, on the other hand, is made by salting and drying strips of a dogfish or shark, which are then usually cooked and served in a sauce.

This hearty stew is made with beef (usually second-grade cuts of tougher meat with lots of fat), onions, tomatoes, beef bouillon, cumin, bay leaves, and fried bacon. The ingredients are placed in a clay pot, then water is added until all the ingredients are covered. The clay pot is traditionally sealed with a ring of dough made from manioc flour and wheat flour. Once prepared, the stew is left to simmer over a low flame anywhere from 12 to 48 hours, resulting in extremely tender meat that falls apart. The name of the dish means <em>covered in mud</em>, referring to the seal of dough on the clay pot. Barreado is usually served over manioc flour to form a gravy, and it is accompanied by rice and sliced bananas.</p>",

    "Description":"<p>Buridda is a famous Italian seafood stew (occasionally also classified as soup) with numerous modern varieties. Traditionally, it was a fisherman&rsquo;s dish made with leftover fish, usually cod and dogfish, which were cut into smaller pieces and stewed together with olive oil, mushrooms, pine nuts, and capers. However, modern varieties include other types of fish such as red mullet, cuttlefish, or monkfish, and usually include onions, tomatoes, and wine. Some regional variations also include crab meat, squids, and fried anchovies, together with peas, artichokes, beets, carrot, celery or olives. The dish originated in the Ligurian area and is often referred to as the Ligurian fish stew. It is particularly connected with the city of Cinque Terre and is often mentioned as one of the most common Italian dishes available in the area. The availability of different fish and traditional vegetables have caused the creation of numerous buridda varieties, and a uniform recipe for this authentic dish is hard to provide. Traditionally, round Italian buns called <em>galette del marinaio </em>are served alongside buridda.</p>",

It is believed that Augustine Iacovelli, the owner of a restaurant called <em>Augies</em> popularized the sandwich. The original marinade, which he called <em>Zuzu</em>, consisted of wine vinegar, water, lemon juice, mint, and garlic, and the sandwich quickly caught on with the local railroad workers and shoemakers. Today, people who live in the Binghamton area regularly enjoy them at restuarants, buy them in supermarkets, or get them from street vendors dispersed throughout the city.</p>",

Before smoking, the salmon is salted through the process of wet or dry curing, which helps with the preservation. The act of smoking might include two techniques, hot smoking, which is less common, and cold smoking, which is the most prevalent method today. Most smoked salmon is commercially produced nowadays, and there is only a handful of traditional smokehouses left. It is one of the most popular meals in the world, and it is especially beloved in the United States and Canada. Americans prefer to eat it for breakfast, when they usually combine it with freshly baked bagels and cream cheese. It is also an irreplaceable ingredient during the famous American brunch, along with being a common ingredient in sandwiches and canap&eacute;s served at picnics and parties. In Europe, it is usually used in pasta sauces or as a topping for bread and sandwiches. This delicacy is also commonly combined with salads, scrambled eggs, and various spreads.</p>",

Traditionally, the fish needs to soak in it for at least 2 or 3 days for the best results. After grilling or broiling, the resulting fish is typically distinguished by an incredibly buttery, silky, and moist texture and an exceptional flavor that pairs well with a variety of accompaniments such as steamed rice, soft tofu, wasabi mashed taters, soba noodle salad, and steamed or pickled vegetables such as baby bok choy, daikon radishes, cucumbers, or ginger shoots. A glass of fine dry white wine would also go well with the sweet, savory, and buttery flavors of this fish specialty. Black miso cod is considered a take on <em>gindara kasukaze</em>, which is a Japanese dish consisting of <em>gindara</em> or silver cod fillets that are cured in sake lees and then grilled.</p>",

The fish needs to be pounded well before consumption so that it becomes flakier and softer, and is then typically enjoyed smeared with cold, salted butter as a snack. High in protein, omega-3 fatty acids, and vitamins, this fish delicacy is often enjoyed as packed lunch or used in stews or soups, and it is also an essential part of the Icelandic <em>&thorn;orramatur</em> buffet, which is traditionally consumed during the midwinter festivals (<em>&THORN;orrabl&oacute;t</em>) in Iceland.

Following this, many regional recipes have been created that use a different combination of ingredients to create various flavorful fillings. However, all of them employ Italian and Mediterranean classics such as various herbs, garlic, prosciutto, capers, pine nuts, and ricotta, parmesan, or pecorino cheese. When filled, the cuttlefish is usually pan-fried, grilled, or baked and finished off with the addition of white wine. The first written recipe for this classic is found in the <em>De re coquinaria</em>, an ancient collection of Roman recipes that was collected around the 4th and 5th century.</p>",

In Angola, the most popular variety is <em>kizaka com peixe</em>, a dish made with fish, onions, and tomatoes, while rice is traditionally served on the side. The dish is popular everywhere in Angola, and it is usually served as a side dish alongside meat or fish dishes. Frequently, green cassava leaves can be substituted with spinach.</p>",

It consists of lightly broiled, sliced bonito (skipjack tuna) that's served with ginger, garlic, and spring onions on the side. The dish is seasoned with vinegar, citrus, and either salt or soy sauce. The fish is broiled over a straw fire until the exterior becomes visibly grilled. By using this method, only the surface is cooked while the interior remains raw, and the smoke from the straw gives the meat a nice smoky flavor. Katsuo no tataki is especially popular at izakaya bars in the area. Interestingly, some claim that the dish was invented by the famous historic figure Sakamoto Ryome, an important samurai of the Bakumatsu era.</p>",

Bananas are so popular in the Caribbean that they are often used in main courses, as side dishes, or even in salads because they are not so sweet and taste similar to potatoes. As for the saltfish, cod is traditionally used, but any other salty fish can replace it. In the past, salt cod was given to slaves due to its low price and high nutritional value. Originally, slaves cooked the fish and bananas with various spices and condiments, so green fig and saltfish was created as a result. The fish had been salted for ages as a way to preserve the food for a longer period of time. Bananas are typically boiled in a deep pan and the fish is boiled and then saut&eacute;ed with cooked bananas, onions, garlic, cabbage, pepper, and tomatoes. The result is a colorful dish with spices that elevate the green bananas and provide excellent flavor. It is prepared on special occasions such as Jounen Kweyol festival in October, but also on weekends for a family lunch.</p>",

When shaping the meatballs, dried fruits such as dates, cherries, or plums are placed and sealed inside them. The k&ouml;fte are cooked by themselves in a saffron-seasoned broth, followed by potatoes, chickpeas, tomatoes, and carrots. When served, the individual portion calls for only one large meatball per person, but nowadays, restaurants will make smaller meatballs for a more balanced dish. Garnished with fresh mint or cilantro, the soup is typically served as the first course at lunchtime.</p>",
