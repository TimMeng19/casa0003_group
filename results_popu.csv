Pizza,"<p>The story of the invention of this everyday household name changes depending on how you define it. If you think a pizza is an oven-baked flatbread, its origins lie in the ancient Middle East. If pizza must have toppings, its origins date back to the ancient Romans and Greeks, who baked flatbreads and topped them with available, local spices and olive oil. But the pizza we all know today, made with tomato sauce, cheese, and numerous toppings, originated in Italy. It became popular in Naples in the 18th century as a cheap, nourishing food that was consumed mainly by peasants. The modern pizza as we know it today evolved from early Neapolitan flatbreads topped with lard, salt, and garlic. No one knows when or why the tomato first began being used in the preparation of pizza, but it is known that they were first recorded in Italy in 1544. While most Europeans initially disparaged them as poisonous, the southern Italians embraced them, giving them the name pomi d&rsquo;oro (golden apples). Although some say that tomatoes have been used on pizza marinara since 1734, others claim that they were not used until the early 19th century. The Italians credit Raffaele Esposito of Pizzeria Brandi as having invented the first modern pizza in 1889. He was supposed to make a variety of pizzas for the queen, so he made one with lard, cheese, and basil, one with fish, and one with mozzarella, basil, and tomatoes. Known as pizza alla mozzarella at the time, this last pizza later became known as pizza margherita, once the queen declared it as her favorite. Interestingly enough, the colors of the margherita are the same as those found on the Italian flag. Pizza crossed over the Italian border shortly thereafter, to Spain, France, England, and the United States, where it was introduced by Italian immigrants. However, it didn&rsquo;t gain much popularity until after World War II. In the United States, the first pizzeria was opened in New York City by Gennaro Lombardi in 1905, and since then it has become one of the most popular food items in the United States. In an ironic twist of fate, American-style pizza has been re-exported back to Italy, where it is has also gained in popularity today. In 2008, two Italian associations called Real Pizza and the Association of Neapolitan Pizza-makers introduced new regulations on what constitutes a true Neapolitan pizza. According to them, the real, legally-protected Neapolitan margherita should be made with exact amounts of mozzarella, salt, and tomatoes, and it should be baked in a wood-fired oven at 485&deg;C. Today, there are numerous variations of this beloved dish throughout the world, from those with simple toppings such as ham, prosciutto, onions, and bell peppers, to unusual variations such as hot dog or hamburger pizza or decadent toppings such as white truffles, edible gold, lobster, and caviar.</p>",102,33.985,11,13.49,289.45,0.046605631,Pizza,/images/dishes/c2fae9d635d84e5e9719701f1a63ff46.png,pizza,40.84002501,14.245011
Sushi,"<p>Sushi is Japan's most famous culinary representative, typically made with rice and fillings which have been rolled inside a a sheet of dry seaweed. However, the term <em>sushi</em> is actually an umbrella term covering a wide range of subvarieties which can be made with a myriad of different ingredients and in as many forms and presentations. Although the dish has become wrongly synonymous with raw fish, the primary ingredient of every type of sushi is only vinegared rice. Originally, sushi was only a method of preserving fish - first developed in Southeast Asia, but it reached Japan in the 8th century. Over time, the dish slowly transformed. Rice was no longer fermented but vinegared and eaten together with fish, and by the 19th century, sushi as we know it today was invented. Besides rice, which can be white or brown, other ingredients include seafood, meat, and vegetables that can be either raw or cooked. Termed as the original type of sushi, <em>nigirizushi </em>is prepared by draping a mound of rice with a sliced topping, frequently with some wasabi in between or on the side, while probably the most popular type of sushi known worldwide is <em>makizushi</em>; small, usually bite-sized cylindrical pieces most commonly wrapped in <em>nori</em> &mdash; a sheet of dry seaweed. Other best-known types of sushi include <em>chirashizushi</em>, served as a bowl of rice topped with a selection of raw ingredients; the pressed variety called <em>oshizushi</em>; <em>inarizushi </em>- deep-fried tofu sacs containing a filling; the traditional <em>narezushi</em> made with fermented rice; and <em>temaki</em>, cone-shaped pieces of seaweed filled with ingredients. Sushi can be eaten with chopsticks or fingers, and it is typically served on a platter or in a bento box with a compartment for dips (usually soy sauce). Due to the worldwide popularity of sushi, many variations of the dish developed outside of Japan.</p>",97,36.88578947,5.398421053,10.86421053,252.4210526,0.043040033,Sushi,/Images/Dishes/e7da1186678e42fa81a8f46b842d91f2.png,sushi,35.6834367,139.7651438
Burger,"<p>A quintessential American food, burger evolved from the German <em>Deutsches beefsteak</em>, according to the <em>New York Times</em> food critic Mimi Sheraton. Its other name (<em>hamburger</em>) is a result of the fact that many German immigrants originally came from the port of Hamburg. Burger is a succulent dish consisting of, ideally, medium-rare seared beef patties tucked in fresh, lightly toasted buns, accompanied by onion slices and ketchup or Dijon mustard. Of course, there is a variety of other condiments and vegetables such as salad greens and tomatoes, but they tend to turn the meat cold, according to Mrs. Sheraton. If cheese is added, it should be mozzarella, Gruyere or Cheddar, slightly melting and mildly pungent. It is yet unclear who first thought to encase the beef patties with buns. Giovanni Ballarini, a food historian, says that the immigrants were given grilled meat between sliced of bread, so there would be no plates involved, and no water was wasted for washing the dishes. Hannah Glasse first mentioned a Hamburg ""<em>sausage</em>"" in her 1747 cookbook <em>The Art of Cookery, Made Plain and Easy</em>, defining it as a chopped mixture of beef and spices that should be served with toast. Or maybe it was Charlie Nagreen, a meatball seller from Wisconsin, who, in 1885, decided to put meatballs between bread so the consumers could eat them while walking at a country fair where he worked. Today, toppings and accompaniments vary from region to region, but for an original version one should visit <em>Louis' Lunch</em> in New Haven, Connecticut, serving the burgers since 1900, and claiming to be the oldest burger joint in the United States. Whatever the theories about the origin of burgers may be, and there are a lot of them, it is a convenient, simple and hearty meal that most meat lovers will gladly indulge in.</p>",96,19.08,18.495,23.275,350.2,0.066462022,Burger,/images/dishes/a32c3623259d4ddf979988d11a7a7141.png,burger,38.8925578,-77.03990137
Ramen,"<p>Ramen is a noodle soup that first appeared in Japan in 1910, when Chinese cooks combined the noodles with a salty broth. These curly noodles were of bright yellow color and more elastic than the Japanese noodles prepared at the time &ndash; the dough was kneaded with a sodium carbonate-infused mineral water called <em>kansui</em>. In 1958, its name was derived from the pronunciation of the Chinese word <em>lamian</em> (pulled noodles), and that same year, <em>Nissin Foods</em> produced the first-ever instant version of noodles with a chicken-flavored broth called <em>Chickin Ramen</em>. Shortly after, the dish started to be exported around the world. Ramen should be cooked <em>al dente</em> and eaten quickly while it is still hot. It is not recommended to leave the noodles sitting in the broth for too long, as they tend to become too soft and mushy. The dish can be either <em>kotteri </em>(rich) or <em>assari/paitan</em> (light), depending on the opaqueness and the heaviness of the broth which is usually made using animal bones or dried seafood mixed with onions, garlic, ginger, leeks, and mushrooms. Two most famous types of ramen are <em>ramen of Kyushu,</em> prepared with a boiled pork bone broth called <em>tonkotsu</em>, and <em>ramen of Hokkaido, </em>made with a traditional seasoning called <em>red miso</em>.</p>",87,43.59473684,10.2,11.52105263,349.6315789,0.03295198,Ramen,/Images/Dishes/e35d99d0270a4ca48d927483db846893.png,ramen,35.68414195,139.7637354
Tacos,"<p>Tacos are the national dish of Mexico, dating back to the Mexican silver mines of the 18th century, when the word <em>taco</em> referred to gunpowder that was wrapped in a piece of paper and inserted into rocks. It was used to excavate the precious ore from mines and was called <em>tacos de minero</em> or <em>miner's tacos.</em> Today, the word is widely known to signify the leading street food and fast food item in Mexico &ndash; thin, flat griddle-baked tortillas topped with numerous fillings, folded and eaten without any utensils. A taco is basically anything eaten on a soft tortilla, and there is an infinite variety of them. In Sonora, in the north of Mexico, they eat the classic <em>carne asada</em> - thinly sliced meat grilled over coals and topped with salsa, onions, guacamole, and a lime wedge. In Baja, the topping consists of fried fish with cabbage and an acidic mayonnaise sauce. In Mexico City, <em>sudados</em> (sweated tacos) are the most popular option, filled with cooked and steamed meat. In Jalisco and Michoacan, they prepare <em>carnitas</em>, eaten in the morning or in the early afternoon, filled with deep fried pieces of pork that are sliced according to preference. Similar is the <em>taco de cabeza</em>, filled with pieces of cow's head that was steamed for a long time, and the customers can choose from slices of eyes, brains, tongue, lips, cheek, or ears. Tacos are mainly made of corn, except in the north, where wheat flour is used more often. They also differ in size, from the tiniest white tacos (<em>blancas</em>) to bigger ones, often made with blue corn. Most tacos come in pairs of two, in order to be able to hold all the flavorful and slightly wet ingredients. Some of them are fried until they become crispy and crunchy, in which case they're called <em>tostadas</em>. As anything can be a filling, there is a version made with fried veins from dried chiles, usually accompanied by salt, a tasty treat called <em>tacos de venas</em>. However, the standard is ground or shredded meat, cheese, potatoes, or vegetables and a topping of onions and coriander. Eaten at all times of day and night, one can find them on every corner in Mexico, in restaurants known as <em>taquerias.</em> Alternatively, they can be bought from numerous street vendors.</p>",86,27.39473684,12.5,19.40526316,311.4210526,0.062311982,Tacos,/images/dishes/dd2302ad0644484f86174c32bea70623.png,tacos,19.44554253,-99.12618961
Croissant,"<p>These flaky, golden-colored, crescent-shaped pastries are best made with pure butter and a slightly sweet yeast dough. If made properly, the yellow-white interior should be just the slightest bit elastic when pulled from the center, ready to be covered with a pad of butter or some fresh jam. Experts agree that the croissant was heavily influenced by Austrian <em>kipfels</em>. This pastry originated in 1683 as a celebration of the Austrian victory over the Ottoman Empire, its shape supposedly mimicking the crescent moon found on the Turkish flag. However, the croissant became French the moment people began to make it with puff pastry, a French innovation. Today, French croissants come filled with chocolate, jam, raisins, or even cream cheese. Sold fresh at numerous French boulangeries, they are mainly consumed as a breakfast item.</p>",72,27.9448,12.686,5.5497,249.501,0.022243197,Croissant,/Images/Dishes/d95337304ef94e558b474985fcc66dea.png,croissant,48.85660016,2.350307284
Cupcake,"<p>A cupcake is a tiny cake that is baked in a thin paper mold or an aluminum cup. One cupcake should typically serve one person. The first mention of a cupcake can be traced back to a 1796 cookbook called <em>American Cookery</em>, written by Amelia Simmons. Her recipe stated that a cake is to be baked in small cups. The term <em>cupcake</em> has first been used in 1828 in Eliza Leslie's <em>Receipts</em> cookbook. Over the years, cupcakes have become a huge industry, and the name cupcake is now given to any small cake that is about the size of a cup. Their popularity is probably owed to the fact that they bake much quicker than larger cakes. Chocolate and vanilla are still the classic flavors, while new ones such as raspberry meringue and espresso fudge can also be found in numerous bakeries and cupcakes shops around the world.</p>",72,36.84866667,13.26916667,2.734,283.9166667,0.009629586,Cupcake,/Images/Dishes/fe887a61b42a424f978cc4dc2e5c3f80.png,cupcake,38.89128855,-77.02188369
Mochi,"<p>Mochi, the tiny cakes made out of glutinous rice, are an important part of Japanese cuisine and culture. The preparation of mochi starts with a time-consuming process of pounding boiled or steamed rice, usually the glutinous <em>mochigome</em> variety until it forms into a thick and homogenous paste. Later it is rolled and shaped into small circular forms. Although its origins might be in China, mochi has been associated with Japan for centuries. It initially appeared during the Yayoi period, when it was only enjoyed by the aristocracy, up until the Heian period, when it became a food that was commonly prepared and served during religious festivities, as people believed it brings fortune and health. Mochi can be incorporated in savory dishes, usually soups and snacks, but most commonly it is made into a confectionery item. In its dessert form, mochi is usually dressed up with food coloring, creating a myriad of delightful color combinations. The most common confectionery is referred to as <em>daifuku </em>- round cakes filled with different ingredients such as the traditional red bean paste, strawberries, or ice cream. Due to its chewy texture, it is important to be extra careful and attentive while eating mochi and to take tiny bites of this glutinous treat.</p>",72,32.95790526,4.200126316,2.097594737,167.6907368,0.01250871,Mochi,/images/dishes/cf8825270eb744c6b36f3913b5ba5dcc.png,mochi,35.68227513,139.7637639
Tortilla,"<p>Tortilla, originally a corn flatbread, is one of the essential bread varieties that has been present in Mexican culture for thousands of years. The first tortilla was created out of the staple ingredient of indigenous cultures, the ubiquitous corn. It was an ingredient used by the ancient Mesoamerican people, who would store the corn kernels and later process them to create <em>masa</em>, which was then formed into balls and hand pressed to create the familiar, round and thin tortilla. This ancient tradition is still present among some native Indian groups, who are excessively trained to perfect the art of making authentic tortillas. The narrative of the tortilla has been inadvertently changed after the arrival of Spanish conquistadors to the area in the 15th century. The conquistadors brought their different culinary traditions, in which wheat played a crucial role, while the authentic corn was regarded as food of the plebeians. However, the tradition of growing and cooking with corn remained popular in rural areas among the indigenous Indians. The emergence of the wheat tortilla is believed to have happened during the colonial time, but what caused its appearance is not quite clear. Some theories claim that it grew out of the European tradition, some that it was an intentional invention of Indians to please the palates of European conquistadors, and some even say that the exiled Spanish Jews created it since they believed corn was not kosher. Regardless of the reason, wheat tortilla has first spread around the area of the Rio Grande River and continued to gain popularity following the agricultural production and advancement. Today, tortillas are not only a Mexican favorite: due to proximity, historical influence, and large Hispanic influx, tortillas have stopped being regarded as an ethnic bread in the United States, and have thoroughly been immersed as a part of the American culinary heritage. Today, tortillas are usually used as a foundation and a wrapper to numerous dishes such as <em>tacos</em>, <em>burritos</em>, <em>enchiladas,</em> and <em>quesadillas</em>. They are also commonly served alongside stews and chilies, where they are often used as an accompaniment and a utensil used to scoop the dish. Whether made with corn or wheat, this ancient Mexican product has gained followers around the world and has become one of the most common bread varieties in the world.</p>",72,19.125,2.9125,3.375,113.25,0.029801325,Tortilla,/Images/Dishes/42c1037dc79c4a10b771d3517d6df3fa.png,tortilla,19.43777261,-99.13442936
Sashimi,"<p>Sashimi is a Japanese delicacy consisting of thinly sliced raw fish or shellfish (or even meat) served with soy sauce and other ingredients such as wasabi or ginger paste. Most common ingredients used in the preparation of sashimi are tuna, squid, scallop, whale, and octopus. Sashimi can be cut in different ways to alter the appearance of the dish, from extremely thin to very thick slices of fish. It is usually served as an appetizer, decorated with shiso leaves, cucumbers, and seaweed (<em>wakame</em> and <em>tosaka-nori</em>). There is a tradition in Japan to serve an odd number of pieces of sashimi on a plate called <em>mukozuke,</em> because it is considered bad luck to have an even number of ingredients. Sashimi is often confused with another popular Japanese dish, <em>sushi</em>, a dish made with raw fish and vinegared rice. Sashimi and sushi also share a common history, as both dishes were originally prepared during the 8th century in Southeast Asia.</p>",67,5.026511765,8.567305882,14.69683529,159.4725353,0.092159037,Sashimi,/Images/Dishes/5e16a76cd7604b57b28b1abefc8d2c7a.png,sashimi,35.68281196,139.7611087
Jiaozi,"<p>These Chinese dumplings known as jiaozi, consisting of a thinly rolled piece of dough which contains either meat or a vegetable filling, are one of the most popular and most commonly eaten dishes in China and East Asia. They can be served either as an appetizer, a side dish, or as the main course, always with a side of soy sauce-based dipping sauce, but traditionally, jiaozi are always eaten for Chinese New Year. Depending on how they are cooked, jiaozi dumplings can be classified into three categories: boiled, steamed, and pan-fried, but when it comes to folding techniques, there are many, and the most popular one is known as <em>pinched-edge fold,</em> which results in crescent-shaped jiaozi, the most popular shape in China. Well-known variations of jiaozi dumplings include the smaller variety <em>gaau ji</em> that has a thin, translucent wrapping, the pan-fried <em>guotie</em>, and the Japanese-style dumpling, <em>gyoza</em>.</p>",66,34.49789474,5.898947368,8.767894737,233.0623684,0.037620379,Jiaozi,/images/dishes/9a7b1fa7d06e44e6b0e0e9b8500a8828.png,jiaozi,39.90500959,116.3902436
Mousse,"<p>This light, fluffy, creamy sweet or savory treat hails from 18th-century France. The word <em>mousse</em> itself means <em>foam</em> in French, and its foamy texture comes from the air bubbles held in suspension throughout it. Sweet mousses are usually made with whipped egg whites or whipped cream, and they come in numerous flavors such as chocolate, vanilla, or strawberry. The most famous, of course, is the chocolate mousse, or <em>mousse au chocolat</em>. Although it isn't known who the inventor of the dish is, the first recipe for chocolate mousse is believed to date from the second half of the 19th century. Once a specialty exclusive to French cuisine, mousse began appearing in American and British restaurants in the 1960s. Today, it enjoys incredible popularity and a place on the table in restaurants worldwide.</p>",66,13.085,6.227,4.863,149.35,0.032561098,Mousse,/Images/Dishes/06ee2239006a4511b5be1fdf490700d3.png,mousse,48.85613168,2.356753159
Dim sum,"<p>Dim sum is a variety of bite-sized food that is usually served with tea. It can range from savory dumplings, buns, and noodle rolls to sweet puddings and tarts. The term <em>dim sum</em> translates to<em> touch the heart</em>, and according to legend, it was invented many centuries ago by cooks of the Royal Court in order to touch the heart of Chinese emperors (but not to fully satiate their hunger). What started as a simple snack is now a key part of Chinese culture. It is also a ritual family dish eaten on most weekend mornings in Hong Kong. Each dish usually consists of a few pieces of dim sum varieties, served in steamer baskets or on small plates, making them great for sharing or trying out new flavors. Whether it is steamed dumplings with pork and prawns, spring rolls, stuffed crab claws, rice porridge congee, pork buns, <em>wo tip</em> dumplings with ground meat or rice noodle rolls, a variety of dim sum will satisfy even the most demanding consumers.</p>",65,19.83033,9.78184,7.58015,189.2823,0.040046798,Dim sum,/images/dishes/7e35477ec56c4725bd1991b2efad5789.png,dim-sum,23.13783831,113.3183043
Brownies,"<p>Deliciously chewy, dense and fudgy with a rich chocolate flavor, the beloved brownies are one of the most popular American desserts. Some claim that Bertha Palmer, wife of the owner of <em>Palmer House Hotel</em>, asked the chef to invent a new chocolate dessert to serve at the 1893 Colombian Exposition. Others say that it was an accident, when Brownie Schrumpf, a librarian, excluded baking powder from a chocolate cake and was left with a thick, black cake bar. Regardless of the origins, what really popularized the brownies were instant, boxed mixes from the 1950s made by two brands - <em>Duncan Hines</em> and <em>Betty Crocker</em>. Of course, the best brownies are not the ones from a box. Some prefer them underbaked, moist, and fudgy on the interior, while some like them well-baked until they develop a spongy texture. The chocolate used for brownies must be of high quality, dark and bittersweet. Nowadays, there is a number of brownie varieties with added walnuts, pecans, chocolate chips, or even chili powder. Portable, easy to prepare and satisfying, brownies are said to taste the best when paired with a glass of cold milk.</p>",63,23.865,9.645,2.635,196.3,0.013423332,Brownies,/Images/Dishes/39620601d2824997b8951d1dbbfd72d3.png,brownies,38.89727023,-77.0365771
Paella,"<p>Widely acclaimed as the most popular Spanish dish, paella combines saffron-flavored rice with a wide array of additional ingredients, such as seafood, vegetables, or meat. Although the original paella was created in Valencia, where it was made with seasonal vegetables, poultry, and rabbit, in modern-day Spain the name is used to denote all rice dishes prepared in a <em>paellera </em>or<em> paella - </em>the traditional shallow pan. The exact additional ingredients used in paella have long been a matter of dispute, but what everyone agrees on is that each paella should have a crispy, caramelized bottom and a subtle saffron flavor. Always served in the pan, this Spanish classic can be found everywhere in the country, in an endless number of combinations.</p>",62,32.03392632,10.05131579,11.84100526,259.0868421,0.045702843,Paella,/Images/Dishes/dae51bd5823a41889f27a63ccfbd323f.png,paella,39.47086499,-0.477080858
Cheeseburger,"<p>Cheeseburger is a natural evolution of the beloved hamburger, the only difference between the two being that the cheeseburger has a slice of cheese added on top of the meat patty. Although American cheese was the original choice, Swiss, Cheddar, and numerous blue cheeses were all used later to make this mouth-watering sandwich. As with most dishes that are extremely popular, the history of the cheeseburger is somewhat complicated. Adding cheese to hamburgers didn't become popular until the mid-1920s, and there are numerous claims as to who invented the first cheeseburger. The most popular theory by far says that it was invented by a 16-year-old short-order cook named Lionel Clark Sternberger at a restaurant called <em>The Rite Spot</em> in Pasadena, California, when he added a slice of American cheese to a sizzling meat patty. Other places also claimed that they invented the cheeseburger, such as <em>Kaelin's Restaurant</em> from Louisville, Kentucky, saying they first made it in 1934. However, the trademark for the name was given to Louis Ballast of the <em>Humpty Dumpty Drive-In</em> in Denver, Colorado in 1935. Today, there are numerous variations on the classic cheeseburger, so it may contain more than one slice of cheese or more than one patty, while the toppings range from bacon, eggs, and ham to chili peppers, mushroom, onions, and guacamole.</p>",61,40.55264,34.1223,22.261895,459.9655,0.048399054,Cheeseburger,/images/dishes/0fc26b8ee5f249009b4b7840237ef882.png,cheeseburger,34.16970094,-118.1483195
Mac and Cheese,"<p>One of the most popular dishes in the United States known as mac and cheese combines tender, yet firm pasta and melted cheese. The preferred American combination includes curved macaroni pasta and Cheddar cheese, but modern varieties include various vegetables, crispy breadcrumb topping, or gourmet ingredients such as crab, lobster, or truffles. Although it is an American staple, the dish was probably inspired by various pasta and cheese dishes that were enjoyed in Italy, France, and the United Kingdom, before its appearance in the United States. It was Thomas Jefferson who eventually popularized it, when he had the pasta machine shipped back home to Virginia and served the dish at his lavish banquets, while in 1824, his distant cousin Mary Randolph published the first mac and cheese recipe. The dish was further popularized in 1937, when the American company <em>Kraft</em> placed the boxed variety on the market. It was cheap and easy to prepare, but also a meal that could feed the whole family. Nowadays, mac and cheese is the ultimate comfort food dish in the United States, and in 2007, it was proclaimed the fourth most iconic American food in a survey conducted by <em>James Beard Foundation</em>.</p>",61,38.294505,11.92861,12.841405,356.54935,0.036015786,Mac and Cheese,/Images/Dishes/9123b408549b42d3995e7063f9a09e36.png,mac-and-cheese,37.53935264,-77.44853518
Wagashi,"<p>Wagashi are traditional Japanese sweets that are usually made from natural, plant-based ingredients such as grains and azuki beans. The sweet treats are typically served with tea and are classified into three categories: <em>namagashi</em> (fresh confectionery), <em>han namagashi</em> (half-dry confectionery), and <em>higashi</em> (dry confectionery). Wagashi is characterized by its design, so in spring, when cherry blossom is in full bloom, the producers make wagashi in cherry blossom shapes, using cherry petals or leaves. The origins of these sweets date back to the Yayoi Era when there was nothing more than natural nuts, fruits, and berries, so wagashi was influenced by the grain processing skills introduced from China. Most of the basic forms of wagashi seen today are derived from that era. The introduction of sugar helped in further development of wagashi, and during the early Edo Period, the sweets developed into numerous varieties and started to be used at tea ceremonies, given as gifts, or consumed as afternoon snacks. After that, wagashi was perfected into the style that we know and love today.</p>",60,31.72368421,3.378947368,3.580526316,172.6842105,0.020734532,Wagashi,/Images/Dishes/2352313e3342450ca0c5559c8c8d28ef.png,wagashi,35.68364231,139.7593182
Barbecue,"<p>Modern American barbecue stems directly from <em>barbacoa</em>, the tradition of smoke-cooking meat which Caribbean natives were doing long before the colonists arrived. Today, the centuries-old technique of smoking whole hogs over a pit is now common in both Virginia and North Carolina. Barbecue was originally found mostly in rural areas, but in recent years it has moved to bigger cities, and how could it not with the aromatic and fragrant appeal of tender, juicy meats, elevating the mouth-watering bites to cult status. Varieties of barbecue are greatly linked to geography with styles varying wildly from North to South and East to West. In Eastern North Carolina, the hog is slowly cooked over coals and doused for hours in a spicy sauce of red pepper flakes and vinegar while being chopped or 'pulled' throughout the process. Pulled pork meat is then stuffed into tender white buns and topped with fresh, mayonnaise-flavored coleslaw. In Western North Carolina, Lexington-style barbecue is king with slowly cooked pork shoulders heavily seasoned with pepper, vinegar, and ketchup sauce. Texas barbecue replaces pork with tender beef briskets cooked in pits, while Kentuckians like to slowly cook mutton in Worcesteshire sauce. Louisiana barbecue differs from all the rest, as the pulled meat served in a soft bun with slaw comes from a suckling pig. Similarly, in South Carolina, pulled pork is drizzled with a mustard and vinegar sauce, while in Kansas the barbecue pork is served on bread with a sauce based on tomatoes and molasses. Traveling to Memphis, one can find barbecued pork ribs with a flavorful, spicy crust achieved by a special dry-rub seasoning. More than just a cooking technique, barbecue is a subculture of its own with rivalry between neighboring states and contests for titles at numerous competitions throughout the South.</p>",58,10.06157895,3.801578947,5.901052632,115.1578947,0.051243144,Barbecue,/Images/Dishes/a357da5ca0d34953b19fee4ad3804b69.png,bbq,29.76016627,-95.36449618
Yakitori,"<p>Yakitori refers to Japanese grilled chicken where pieces of chicken meat are skewered with a particular type of skewer called <em>kushi </em>(which can be made from either steel or bamboo) and are then traditionally grilled over a charcoal fire. Depending on the cut of chicken and the method of preparation, there are various types of this dish. An important step in the making of yakitori is the seasoning, either salty or salty-sweet, which can be done during or after grilling. Salty seasoning is just salt that can sometimes be combined with pepper, while salty-sweet seasoning is actually <em>tare</em> sauce made from <em>mirin</em>, soy sauce, sake, and sugar. Present-day versions of yakitori first appeared during the Meiji Era in the 19th century, but once chicken became abundantly available in the 1950s, the popularity of skewered chicken skyrocketed and the dish became popular among the masses. In Japan, yakitori can be purchased in specialized yakitori shops called <em>yakitori-ya</em>, but it is also often served in Japanese gastropubs known as <em>izakaya</em>. Since skewered chicken is so easy to prepare, plus it's portable, it is also a popular street food sold at <em>yatai</em>, the small Japanese food stalls. The dish is meant to be eaten with hands only, often directly off the skewer, and can be paired with a side of roasted vegetables, while each bite should ideally be washed down with ice-cold beer.</p>",58,10.22430556,5.572555556,10.76430556,135.3431111,0.079533457,Yakitori,/Images/Dishes/b2964506be394ed1907480a8bdf9ab3a.png,yakitori,35.68021011,139.7634368
Onigiri,"<p>Moist, chewy, and hearty, onigiri or omusubi are Japanese rice balls and a favorite picnic food since the 11th century, when they were known as <em>tonjiki</em> and recorded as such in the diary of Lady Murasaki, author of <em>The Tale of Genji </em>(which is believed to be the world's first novel!). However, the origins of the dish are much earlier than the time of Lady Murasaki. In the Nara period, before chopsticks became popular, rice used to be rolled into small balls in order to be easily picked up and consumed. Typically, onigiri is wrapped in nori seaweed, but that practice did not come about until the late 16th century. The stuffings might include salmon, umeboshi plums, grilled or pickled mushrooms, or various vegetables. Today, onigiri is often made at home and sold everywhere throughout Japan, from parks and beaches to convenience stores or upscale grocery stores.</p>",58,35.74101579,3.890863158,4.428331579,200.1118421,0.022129283,Onigiri,/images/dishes/4add50769898480498594eb37dc319d6.png,onigiri,35.68283083,139.7615723
Roti,"<p>Roti is a flat and unleavened bread made with wholemeal flour. It is traditionally cooked on an iron griddle called <em>tava</em>, an important vessel in the Indian cuisine. In Indian cuisine, roti is as essential as rice. There are several theories regarding its origin. One says that it was invented in Persia, when it was made with maida and was much thicker than today's rotis. Another theory says that it traveled to India from East Africa, where unleavened bread was a staple and the production of wheat was abundant. The Ayurveda dates it back to India's Vedic period. Regardless of the origin, roti is nowadays popular throughout the world, in countries such as Pakistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Maldives, South Africa, and South Asia. Its name stems from the Sanskrit word <em>??????????????????</em>, meaning <em>bread</em>. There are many variations of the basic roti, such as <em>chapati, makki di roti, tandoori roti</em>, and<em> roti canai</em>. It is commonly used as an accompaniment to various dishes, including curries, and on the Caribbean, it is commonly used as a sandwich wrap and consumed as street food.</p>",57,30.5535,8.748,13.9825,259.65,0.053851338,Roti,/images/dishes/c3963e57d9b848308297706a2c665ee5.png,roti,28.61313467,77.2171315
Risotto,"<p>This widely popular and extremely versatile group of dishes consists of a base of rice and stock. Butter, saffron, and parmesan are some of the ingredients most often combined with the base to make a variety of flavorful risottos. The history of the dish is rife with conflicting theories about its origins, however, it is certain that rice was first introduced to Italy by the Arabs during the Middle Ages. Since the Mediterranean climate was perfect for growing short-grain rice, it began being sold in huge amounts, primarily in Venice, Genoa, and the surrounding areas. As rice gained in popularity, it became a staple food of the Po valley, Lombardy, Piedmont, Veneto, and the city of Milan. It was only a matter of time before rice was combined with saffron, which the Milan region was famous for, and the legendary risotto alla Milanese was invented. Even today, risotto is still usually prepared using the same key components: rice, stock, butter, wine, parmesan, saffron, and onions. The dish is served throughout the world, so there are also a number of varieties with ingredients such as truffles, squid ink, asparagus, sausage, scallops, and veal.</p>",57,47.69777778,6.741111111,8.713888889,322.6111111,0.027010505,Risotto,/Images/Dishes/533927674d0d41178e023d74d4925f42.png,risotto,45.46421083,9.191198963
Tagliatelle al rag?? alla Bolognese,"<p>Even though they are often thought to be synonymous, tagliatelle al rag&ugrave;&mdash;one of Bologna's signature dishes&mdash;bears little or no resemblance to the dish known as spaghetti Bolognese in the rest of the world. In fact, the world famous Italian rag&ugrave; alla Bolognese meat sauce is never served with spaghetti in Bologna. Instead, when it isn't served over fresh tagliatelle, you will most often find it topping a bed of some other other ribbon-like pasta, such as fettuccine or pappardelle. Regardless of the type of pasta used, what makes or breaks this classic Emilian dish is the rag&ugrave; itself. Experts nowadays tend to consider the recipe for rag&ugrave; alla Bolognese registered by the Italian Academy of Cuisine in October 1982 the most authentic version. However, chances are that every restaurant and trattoria in Emilia Romagna dishes out its own version of tagliatelle al rag&ugrave;, and each version is surely worth trying.</p>",57,23.66894737,8.146842105,9.338947368,217,0.043036624,Tagliatelle al rag?? alla Bolognese,/Images/Dishes/04fcac43cce44607802afc893a75a0c7.png,bolognese,44.5004999,11.33926222
Milkshake,"<p>Milkshakes are usually described as flavored milk and ice cream beverages, usually lavishly decorated and served cold. The first written mention, dating from 1885, was somewhat different, and the word was used to refer to a whiskey drink, similar to <em>eggnog</em>, which was used as a health remedy. At the end of the 19th century, milkshakes were already prepared as milk-based drinks made with flavored syrups. The invention of malted milk powders which contained dried milk, malted barley, and wheat flour, along with the popularization of electric blenders, inspired the creation of a more familiar milkshake version. These inventions transformed the old-fashion milkshake into a creamy and airy form that we are more familiar with today. The final contribution to the modern milkshake was made by Ivar &ldquo;Pop&rdquo; Coulson, an employee at the <em>Walgreens</em> supermarket, who added scoops of vanilla ice-cream to the already famous malted drink. The creamy, cold drink became an instant hit among the Americans, especially teenagers, who would regularly enjoy their milkshakes in diners and fast-food restaurants. The soda fountains equipped with different flavored milkshakes were also put in drugstores as a quick and convenient refreshment. Although not as popular as they were in the 1950s and the 1960s, they are still a crucial part of American culture, reminiscent of youth and enjoyment. This frothy, refreshing beverage is also favored in Australia and the United Kingdom, where it is usually sold in fast-food restaurants and specialized establishments. Modern-day milkshakes, on the other hand, include some unusual varieties such as mango or mocha, and might include luxury ingredients or even be spiked with alcohol. The recent growth in popularity has led to the emergence of numerous artisan shops which create show-stopping milkshake creations infused with popular candies, whipped cream, marshmallows, and even bacon or blended doughnuts!</p>",57,67.68268235,14.10404706,12.47995294,456.8903529,0.027314985,Milkshake,/Images/Dishes/2300b893a58248a89d867ce4cd0cad70.png,milkshake,38.89523125,-77.03686492
Macarons,"<p>These small, round, sweet meringue-based cookie sandwiches with filling in the middle are light and crunchy on the outside and chewy in the middle. Macarons, which first appeared in Italy in 1533 (albeit without the filling), got their name from the Italian word <em>maccherone</em>, which means <em>fine dough</em>. They were originally made for the marriage of the Duke of Orl&eacute;ans, who later became King Henry II of France. Food historians credit Pierre Desfontaines as the inventor of the macaron. He was the first to fill the cookies with a creamy ganache and stick them together, turning the humble almond cookie into the versatile treat we know today. Macarons are the most popular type of cookie in Paris, but they are popular throughout the rest of the world as well, and they appear with different fillings and in various sizes, colors, and flavors.</p>",57,27.83,8.9255,4.355,211.330975,0.020607485,Macarons,/Images/Dishes/758f817fe9e14cee87217533a71a8231.png,macarons,48.86592829,2.333968289
Quiche,"<p>This popular French pie consists of a pastry crust filled with eggs, cream, and anything from bacon, cheese, and leek to mushrooms and seafood. Quiche is usually very filling and high in calories, making it a frequent choice for parties and buffet tables. It can be served either hot or cold, and is traditionally cut into slices. Numerous varieties of quiche exist today, the most popular of which are <em>quiche Lorraine</em>, <em>quiche Florentine</em>, and <em>quiche Proven&ccedil;ale</em>.</p>",56,20.4285,18.3585,14.463,285.9125,0.050585406,Quiche,/images/dishes/ba743842e9db46a18624088154fdd565.png,quiche,48.85647986,2.346814728
Kimchi,"<p>Although many people get a chill through their spine at the very mention of the word <em>pickles</em>, Koreans have found a way to make fermented pickled vegetables interesting, tasty and titillating. A classic starter or a side dish to any Korean meal, these spicy, salty, sweet and sour vegetables known as kimchi start their way sliced, tied in bundles, and marinated in brine with hot chili peppers, salty fish paste, leeks, ginger, sugar, and garlic. Although the popularity of kimchi is still rising in the West, it is an ancient dish, dating about two thousand years back, when it was first mentioned in written documents. It was originally called <em>chimchae</em>, literally translated to <em>soaked vegetables</em>, because kimchi was soaked only in brine or beef stock in the past, but by the 12th century, other ingredients and seasonings began to be added to the pot. Nowadays, kimchi is made both in North and South Korea, the Southern version being more salty and spicy than the Northern one. Seasons also play a role in the flavors of kimchi - refreshing cucumber kimchi is popular in spring and summer, while winter kimchis may contain radish and mustard leaves. Due to its sharp and pungent odor, it is traditionally fermented outdoors, buried in barrels or crock pots. Even though it is served as an appetizer, it usually stays on the table during the whole meal, accompanying classics such as <em>bulgogi</em>, <em>kalbi</em>, and <em>mandu guk</em> (dumpling soup), while cabbage kimchi is often fried into kimchijeon pancakes and incorporated into numerous soups and stews. A staple of any Korean meal, the dish is so beloved that the locals even shout ""kimchi!"" when their picture is taken, in the same manner that Americans shout ""cheese!"".</p>",56,6.872610526,1.701784211,2.428221053,51.73398421,0.046936672,Kimchi,/Images/Dishes/40dd1cc6c8f94df1b8d3875cb4bfb7d4.png,kimchi,37.56605392,126.9810164
Doughnut,"<p>Although archaeologists had found some petrified remains of fried cakes with holes in the center, it is still unclear how could the early Native Americans prepare these delicious fried dough desserts that we know today as doughnuts. In the past, doughnuts were known as <em>olykoeks</em> (oily cakes), and the pilgrims from Holland are credited for bringing them to the United States. Those early doughnuts were often made with prunes, raisins, or apples in the middle. During World War I, the doughnut was already an American favorite, consumed by soldiers that were fighting overseas as a reminder of home. In the 1950s and the 1960s, the popularity of these treats was so big that new doughnut chains started appearing on the market, such as <em>Krispy Kreme</em> and <em>Dunkin' Donuts</em>, helping in the perception of doughnuts as breakfast food. Today, there are numerous varieties of doughnuts - glazed, powdered, filled, topped with frosting, coconut, peanuts, or sprinkles, and every year on the first Friday of June people celebrate the National Doughnut Day. This event was initially created by the Salvation Army in 1917 as a way to support the morale of the American troops during World War I and was later re-established in 1938, in honor of those who served the soldiers with fresh doughnuts during World War I.</p>",56,34.48488889,15.025,3.599111111,287.9777778,0.012497878,Doughnut,/Images/Dishes/9bbbe5a1d78b408c8385a019bc2125e7.png,doughnut,38.89374416,-77.03569376
Tiramis??,"<p>Even though tiramis&ugrave; is actually a fairly recent invention, this dessert of coffee-soaked ladyfingers layered with mascarpone cream enjoys an iconic status among Italian desserts. Its name stems from the phrase <em>tirami s&ugrave;</em>, an Italian expression which literally means <em>pick me up</em>, a reference to the uplifting effects of sugar, liquor, and coffee. The origins of tiramis&ugrave; are heavily disputed between Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia regions, but it is often suggested that the first was made in Veneto in the early 1980s. In fact, the earliest documented recipe for tiramis&ugrave; (interestingly, without alcohol!) was printed in the 1981 spring edition of <em>Vin Veneto</em> magazine in an article on coffee-based desserts by Giuseppe Maffioli, a renowned food critic and member of the Italian Academy of Cuisine. However, in August 2017, Friuli-Venezia Giulia's tiramisu was officially added to the list of traditional regional dishes, but a Veneto local won the Tiramisu World Cup in November 2017, so the playing field is somewhat levelled once again. Regardless of these disputes, the perfect tiramis&ugrave; should always deliver a serious caffeine kick from a shot of strong espresso, while brandy-fortified Marsala wine adds a nice sweet buzz.</p>",56,30.1755,14.5715,4.821,287.9,0.016745398,Tiramis??,/images/dishes/916715120ac341ba9135e3a1e74411ab.png,tiramisu,45.65011129,13.77033383
Fudge,"<p>Fudge is a creamy American confectionery made with milk, sugar, butter, and various toppings and flavorings. It is created by boiling milk, butter, and sugar to a degree of 240 &deg;F/116 &deg;C, and then beating it while it cools down, creating creamy but firm blocks which are later cut into delicate individual pieces. In the United States, modern producers replaced the milk with cream, creating an even smoother and sweeter product. Although fudge is probably an original American invention, it is thought that predecessors to fudge were French classics such as <em>fondant</em> and <em>caramel</em>. Numerous theories claim that fudge was an accidental product, invented when an unintentional mistake occurred while creating the famous French caramel candy. The first written mention of fudge goes back to 1921, when Evelyn B. Hartridge, a student at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, wrote to her professor claiming that the first reference to fudge goes back to 1886. She writes that it was invented in Baltimore by her acquaintance, and was sold for 40 cents per pound. Hartridge later started producing and selling it, making it an extremely popular product, first at numerous universities, and then everywhere in the country. The popularity of fudge led to the opening of numerous shops specialized in the production of many fudge varieties. The first shops appeared on the Mackinac Island in Michigan, which is still considered to be the American fudge capital. Despite modern techniques, this creamy American product is still predominately bought from specialized stores, and freshly prepared it represents a luscious treat, enjoyed by people of all ages. The most popular fudge flavor is undoubtedly chocolate, followed by traditional plain vanilla. Other popular versions include varieties created with pecan nuts, peanut butter, marshmallows, cookies, or mint. Americans prefer to consume them during the Christmas holidays and the summer season, when they are usually bought and carried home as souvenirs and gifts. This authentic American product is also popular in the United Kingdom, where the fudge-specialized shops also exist and produce their traditional varieties. <em>Hot fudge</em>, the heated and more liquid type, is often used as a topping for ice creams and sundaes across the United States and Canada.</p>",54,17.60124,4.514485,0.698315,134.5185,0.005191219,Fudge,/Images/Dishes/0c7203e2285d493db1e600d95dfba739.png,fudge,39.30020651,-76.61989182
Baozi,"<p>One of China's favorite breakfast foods and an everyday snack, baozi - or simply <em>bao</em>, as it&rsquo;s usually called - is a steamed bun, made with the so-called <em>mantou</em> bread, and stuffed with a wide variety of fillings ranging from savory to sweet, but they typically include various meats, seafood, or vegetables. Most popular types are <em>char siu bao</em>, filled with Cantonese-style barbecued pork; the smaller, mincemeat-filled Shanghai-style baozi called <em>xiao long bao</em> or <em>Shengjian mantou</em>; and the succulent <em>tangbao</em> or <em>guantang bau</em>, large soup-filled bao buns made with pork or crab stock. These are usually served in their own individual steaming basket, with a straw used to drink the soup while the rest of the bun is eaten later. The flavorful baozi buns were originally known as a peasant dish, but with high-end restaurants breathing new life into this working-class Chinese staple, the once humble steamed bun is finally seeing its renaissance. In China, however, they are still found in virtually every corner, freshly prepared on the spot using bamboo steaming baskets, and sold by numerous street vendors.</p>",53,29.23263158,4.757894737,6.606315789,193.5263158,0.034136524,Baozi,/images/dishes/6dc63ead02bd4a98b08b75dd7bd645a8.png,baozi,39.90496672,116.3871892
Gyoza,"<p>The famous Japanese gyoza are crescent-shaped dumplings that have originated from the traditional Chinese <em>jiaozi</em> dumplings. The recipe was slightly altered to accommodate the Japanese taste, and gyoza soon became one of the favorite Japanese meals. They consist of a thin wrapper made with wheat flour, eggs, and water, which is then stuffed with a mixture of meat and vegetables. The ingredients used in the stuffing are regionally influenced, but most commonly include minced pork or chicken, cabbage, chives, a substantial amount of garlic, ginger, and green onions. They are traditionally prepared in three different ways. The most famous are <em>pan-fried gyoza</em>, which are fried and then shortly steamed. Other types include <em>boiled gyoza</em>, usually served in broth, and the less common <em>deep-fried</em> variety. Traditionally, these scrumptious dumplings are served with a dipping sauce on the side, usually made with rice vinegar, soy sauce, and sesame oil. Since the 1940s, gyoza have been slowly making their progress to become one of the staple foods in Japan, commonly consumed everywhere in the country. They can be found on the menus of traditional Japanese restaurants and bought at specialized gyoza shops. In restaurants, they are usually offered as a starter, as a part of dim sum, or as a side dish to main meals, but gyoza are most commonly enjoyed as a snack, followed by a glass of cold beer or traditional sake.</p>",53,32.002615,7.112535,9.53854,235.525155,0.040499029,Gyoza,/images/dishes/42bd0db47b58458f83d0c3d9635e2450.png,gyoza,35.68244383,139.7580481
Wonton,"<p>Often referred to as the <em>Chinese ravioli</em>, wontons are a variety of thin-skinned dumplings with meat, seafood or vegetable filling enclosed in tender wheat dough wrappers. Many sources suggest that the origins of wontons date back to the Han dynasty era, when they used to be prepared for the Chinese ancestor worship rituals as offerings to the spirits of the deceased. As the Han era concluded, circa 220 CE, the northern Chinese farmers who had long grown wheat discovered they could ground this grain into flour and knead it with water. From this practice emerged an entire world of new dishes known as <em>bing</em>, which was a collective name for steamed breads, grilled flatbreads, noodles, and various dumplings. These dishes soon became so popular they were sold anywhere from river boat food vendors to the streets, enjoyed both by royalty and the common folk. Over time, wontons have evolved and spread from Northern China throughout the country and beyond. Traditionally prepared during the Winter Solstice Festival, they were cooked in chicken broth until almost translucent and enjoyed as a heartwarming soup typically flavored with white pepper, sesame, and oyster oil. Nowadays, wontons are available in numerous varieties. In the North, they are most often stuffed with pork or lamb, while the classic Shanghainese filling includes minced pork and <em>bok choy</em> cabbage, flavored with the wild green called <em>shepherd&rsquo;s purse</em>. Further to the south, people make their wontons with egg wrappers and fill them with a combination of pork and shrimp, while in Cantonese cuisine, wontons are often served as an appetizer, deep-fried and smothered in sweet-and-sour sauce. In the neighboring province of Fujian, they are better known as <em>bianshi</em> and are sometimes stuffed with fish paste. The so-called <em>three treasure wontons</em>, also known as <em>Sanxian huntun</em> or <em>wuxi Sanxian</em> wontons are stuffed with pork, dried shrimps, and pickled vegetables, and typically served in a spicy tofu and egg soup. Sichuan pork wontons are called <em>chao shou</em>, and they are traditionally served either in <em>qing tang</em>, a clear vegetable broth flavored with cilantro and other leafy greens, or in a spicy <em>hong you</em> chili oil sauce. Hong Kong-style wontons are filled with shrimp and lightly seasoned pork flavored with ginger, yellow chives, soy sauce, and sesame oil.</p>",52,24.71565789,6.186352632,7.0255,182.6846842,0.038456973,Wonton,/images/dishes/22101dfcce334266b6c8799cf79b5636.png,wonton,39.89376595,116.3994901
Fried Chicken,"<p>The most popular food of the Southern cuisine, fried chicken is the theme of many arguments where everyone involved seems to have a favorite, be it what their mothers used to make, a cult roadside eatery, or a bygone restaurant. However, it is universally agreed that the meat must be moist, succulent, and tender, coated with a crunchy, golden-brown crust. It all started during the colonization period, when Scottish immigrants settled in the South, bringing their fried chicken recipes along. The African slaves then introduced new seasonings and spices, and the dish quickly gained popularity. Typical seasonings include salt, pepper, and hot chiles, and the pieces of meat should be edible by hand so that the consumer can bite both the crust and the meat at the same time. The birds must be fresh and smaller in size, as the meat will be much more tender and the proportion of crust to meat will be perfectly balanced. Once the chicken parts are hot, crispy, and ready to be consumed, they are traditionally accompanied by buttered biscuits, Southern potato salad, mashed potatoes, or cream gravy on the side.</p>",51,13.5705,13.7594,23.3242,305.41,0.076370125,Fried Chicken,/images/dishes/0a19728732d542928c743b6a46ff54b5.png,fried-chicken,38.20181876,-84.87586424
Pho,"<p>Pho is a Vietnamese noodle soup, Vietnam's national dish, street food, comfort food, and a way of life. It is also one of the most beloved Vietnamese dishes in the western hemisphere due to its complex, unique flavors, and elegant simplicity. Although it is classified as a soup, pho is served as the main course and the two bowls of it never taste the same. It is traditionally made with chicken or beef broth, where the bones simmer lazily for at least three hours until the broth is perfect. The addition of herbs and spices accentuates the flavors, and the chewy rice noodles, juicy beef slices, and crunchy sprouts elevate the dish to another level. There are two main types of Pho in Vietnam - one is <em>Pho Bac</em>, made in the northern parts of the country, with a clear, simple, delicate flavor and spices, without the herbs and garnishes found in <em>Pho Nam</em>, which is made in the southern parts of the country, with added spices, bean sprouts, various toppings, fish, and hoisin sauce. It is believed that pho derived from the French <em>pot au feu</em>, but regardless of the legend's truthfulness, pho still remains a staple of comfort food - warm, hearty, and delicious.</p>",51,52.30055556,5.903333333,30.025,414.0540556,0.072514686,Pho,/images/dishes/4aa22608c7404f37b1c6c27188a36704.png,pho,21.02790427,105.8573371
Burrito,"<p>Burrito is a dish consisting of a wheat flour tortilla that is wrapped in such a way that it is possible to fully enclose the flavorful filling on the interior. The filling consists of a combination of various ingredients such as meat, beans, rice, lettuce, guacamole, and cheese, among others. Its name means <em>little donkey</em> in Spanish, and a popular theory suggests that it stems from the way the bedrolls and packs appeared on the donkeys that carried them. Some claim that the dish originated in the 19th century by either the <em>vaqueros</em> in Northern Mexico, farmers in California, or the miners from Sonora. The first appearance of burrito in American restaurants was recorded in the early 1920s in Los Angeles, when the owner Alejandro Borquez opened the <em>Sonora Caf&eacute;</em> and started serving the dish. He changed the name of the restaurant to <em>El Cholo Spanish Caf&eacute;</em>, and it's still in business. Once it became popular across the United States, numerous variations of the dish started appearing, such as <em>Thai chicken burrito</em>, <em>Chinese pork burrito</em>, and <em>breakfast burrito</em>.</p>",51,43.106085,15.3744,20.112115,391.79,0.051333916,Burrito,/images/dishes/cc631bcc9710494098dfbcb42862f0ab.png,burrito,31.69037701,-106.490048
Nachos,"<p>The first, original plate of nachos consisting of tortilla chips, melted chips, and jalape&ntilde;os was made for a group of military officers' wives in 1943 in Piedras Negras, Mexico. The ladies of the US Army Air Force base went over to a restaurant in the city, called the <em>Victory Club</em>. Its maitre d', Ignacio ""Nacho"" Anaya couldn't find the cook, so he combined some readily available ingredients for the ladies and presented them with canapes of tortilla chips, cheese, and jalape&ntilde;o peppers. Nachos were created, and Anaya became the restaurant's head chef a few years later. The dish was named after his nickname, and was advertised on both sides of the border as <em>Nacho Specials</em>. The combination of chips and melted cheese quickly gained popularity, so by the 1960s, it became a staple of Tex-Mex cuisine. Some people credit a man named Frank Liberto for turning the nachos into a global phenomenon, since he is the one who turned the dish into stadium food in the United States, greatly increasing the sales of nachos and boosting their popularity even more. Today, common toppings include ingredients such as beans, <em>elote</em> corn, guacamole, lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and meat, and there is even a special event called the <em>International Nacho Festival</em>, held every October in Piedras Negras.</p>",51,56.44705882,36.26352941,19.22941176,885.2,0.02172324,Nachos,/Images/Dishes/cc4a425a59a54f529ad395623431a411.png,nachos,28.70871777,-100.5310418
Bulgogi,"<p>It's hard to say which is better: the succulent meat or spicy side dishes that define bulgogi, the Asian barbecue style in which thin slices of marinated meat are quickly cooked over high heat on top of a perforated, round metal plate that covers the grill's piping hot coals. The name of the dish stems from <em>bool</em> and <em>kogi</em>, Korean words denoting <em>fire</em> and <em>meat</em>. The earliest form of the dish originates from the Goguryeo period, when the meat was marinated before grilling, unlike the standard Chinese practice of seasoning the meat after it has been grilled. The marinade traditionally consists of honey, sesame, soy sauce, garlic, and scallions, while the alternatives for beef, chicken, and pork can be either tofu, shrimp, or squid. Typical for Korean food, the meat always comes to the table with a variety of accompaniments and side dishes such as rice, lettuce leaves, scallion pancakes, kimchi, and the omnipresent <em>gochujang</em>. What harissa is to Moroccan cuisine and what ketchup is to burgers and hot dogs in the USA, gochujang is to bulgogi, a fiery hot condiment made from dried chili peppers, soybean paste, and rice powder, all slowly fermented in huge clay pots, giving a pungent kick both to bulgogi, served at every Korean dinner party, and a variety of other meat and rice dishes.</p>",49,25.59247,24.62226,36.440405,472.9971,0.077041498,Bulgogi,/images/dishes/aa376b90aeec4faf80eb29095f40c4fa.png,bulgogi,37.56538476,126.9774569
Bibimbap,"<p><em>Bibim</em> means <em>mixed</em>, and <em>bap</em> means <em>cooked rice</em>, so bibimbap is literally <em>mixed rice. </em>The rice is combined with a variety of ingredients such as sliced beef, namul (sliced vegetables), soy sauce, gochujang (thick, deep red chili pepper paste), and a raw egg on top, cooking as it is dispersed through the steaming rice. One of the most popular Korean dishes besides bulgogi and kimchi, bibimbap is said to have been invented out of necessity, just like many other national dishes. In Korea, there is a tradition that any leftover food from New Year's Eve should not be brought over into the New Year, so it started the practice of combining different ingredients with rice in a bowl, and bibimbap was created. Another theory says that it was a traditional dish for the workers during the harvest, as it is easily prepared in large quantities to feed a large number of people, and the first time that the dish was mentioned by name is found in a 19th century cookbook called <em>Siuijeonseo</em>. Regardless of its origins, Koreans claim that it heals the body, releases energy, and protects the consumers from illness during winter, so it is not a wonder that bibimbap is regarded as the ultimate comfort food.</p>",49,75.75410526,16.05793684,24.78597368,563.1953684,0.044009548,Bibimbap,/images/dishes/ae82b53971e8476684ed301bf4e21a4c.png,bibimbap,37.56600276,126.982543
Tonkatsu,"<p>The breaded, deep-fried pork cutlet <em>tonkatsu</em> is a Japanese dish with a very recent history. It first appeared at the end of the 19th century as a type of <em>yoshoku</em> &mdash; the Western-influenced Japanese dishes &mdash; but with time, tonkatsu has become increasingly Japanized, widely available to the masses and thus more popular. Tonkatsu is a dish in itself or, if married with other ingredients, it can turn into many of its almost endless variations; made like a sandwich, paired with ramen or rice, poured over with a thick miso sauce as done in Nagoya, or served with curry to make <em>katsu kar??</em>. As a result of such popularity, many other fried dishes were developed using ham, beef, minced patties, and chicken as substitutes. For serving, tonkatsu is sliced, then placed on a plate together with shredded cabbage. Rice and miso come in separate bowls, while pickled vegetables and a citrus-based sauce are placed on the side. An essential element is the seasoning, traditionally either a type of thick Worcestershire sauce called <em>s??su</em> or mustard.</p>",49,21.77593684,11.56358947,15.56704737,257.8273158,0.060377805,Tonkatsu,/images/dishes/8ef2edbcbcbf4759b485d3d33e4b2207.png,tonkatsu,35.68196204,139.7581633
Dashi,"<p>One of the fundamental ingredients in Japanese cuisine, dashi is a type of soup and cooking stock often used as the base for different miso and noodle soups, <em>donburi</em> or rice bowl dishes, stews and many other kinds of <em>nimono</em> or simmered dishes. Dashi is typically made from <em>kombu</em> (dried kelp), <em>katsuobushi</em> (dried and smoked skipjack tuna), <em>iriko</em> or <em>niboshi</em> (anchovies or sardines), or a combination of these ingredients, all of which are naturally rich in glutamates and thus deliver an intense <em>umami</em> flavor to a number of Japanese dishes. There are several types of dashi and deciding on which kind of dashi to use for a particular dish depends solely on one's preference. <em>Awase dashi</em> is the most common all-purpose seafood-based stock made from a combination of kombu and bonito flakes. It is most often used for preparing dishes such as <em>miso soup</em>, <em>oyakodon</em>, <em>oden</em>, <em>nikujaga</em>, <em>chikuzenni</em>, <em>tamagoyaki</em>, etc. <em>Kombu dashi</em> is a vegetarian stock made exclusively with kombu; it has a mild flavor and goes well with either vegetable or fish-based dishes such as yudofu or clamp soup, as it doesn't overpower other flavors. <em>Iriko</em> or <em>niboshi dashi</em> is a seafood-based stock made from dried baby anchovies or sardines; it has a strong fishy aroma, but its flavor is not as strong. Compared to katsuobushi and kombu, this dashi is more affordable and most commonly used for making miso soup, noodle soup dishes like <em>curry udon</em> or <em>kitsune udon</em>, as well as various donburi and nimono dishes. <em>Shiitake dashi</em> is another vegetarian stock made by rehydrating dried shiitake mushrooms. It is rarely used on its own; instead, it is usually combined with other kinds of dashi to enhance the flavor and add umami to various noodle soups and simmered dishes.</p>",48,4.908344444,0.516383333,4.519944444,39.65225,0.113989608,Dashi,/images/dishes/fc0fc71f2af043f8955738acab567081.png,dashi,35.68282239,139.7630704
Chocolate Chip Cookie,"<p>Usually accompanied by a glass of milk or a cup of hot tea or coffee, chocolate chip cookies are well balanced between salty and sweet in flavor, tenderly chewy in texture, and filled with small melting chocolate pyramids, bringing a generation of Americans back to their childhood. The origin story of these sweet treats is incredibly interesting, almost as the cookies themselves. The Toll House Inn was a popular bed-and-breakfast in Whitman, Massachusetts, bought by Ruth Graves Wakefield and her husband in 1930. Ruth's cooking was so good that the inn gained an excellent reputation in a short span of time. Enter Duncan Hines, a traveling salesman from Kentucky who began compiling a list of the best roadside eateries in 1935. First, he included the Toll House Inn's Indian pudding on the list, and a decade later, he also included the chocolate chip cookies that we all know and love today. Ruth was baking chocolate cookies when she found out that she didn't have any more baker's chocolate. Instead, she used a new, semisweet chocolate that she got from her friend Andrew Nestl&eacute;, broke it into small pieces, and places them in her batter for buttered sugar cookies. The chocolate didn't melt like she thought it would, and the result was a cookie that Ruth originally called the <em>Toll House chocolate crunch cookie</em>. The Boston press published her recipe, and the sales of both Nestl&eacute; chocolate and the cookies skyrocketed. Nestl&eacute; and Wakefield made a deal - he would print the recipe on the chocolate, and she would get a lifetime supply of chocolate. The recipe is printed on the chocolate package up to this day, giving everyone a chance to make their own chocolate chip cookies.</p>",48,26.11094737,8.206105263,2.601578947,183.1368421,0.014205656,Chocolate Chip Cookie,/Images/Dishes/79433b5fbfc147dbbb5ba14e9d98c703.png,toll-house-chocolate-chip-cookies,42.08080581,-70.93553457
Fajitas,"<p>Fajitas is a popular Tex-Mex dish made from marinated, grilled skirt steak that is served in a wheat flour tortilla. The earliest printed mention of the word fajita referring to food appeared in 1975, and ten years later it had become one of the most popular dishes of Tex-Mex cuisine. The word <em>fajita</em> is derived from the Spanish <em>faja</em>, meaning <em>girdle</em> or <em>strip</em>, referring to a cheap cut of beef covering the diaphragm that was considered somewhat undesirable by many locals. In the 1940s, Mexican ranch workers used to tenderize the skirt steak by pounding and marinating it in lime juice before cooking it over an open fire and serving the meat in a wheat tortilla along with numerous condiments. Today, fajitas can be filled with grilled chicken, shrimp, and even vegetables, because the more popular the dish became, the less likely it was to be made with skirt steak. Typical condiments include ingredients such as lettuce, sour cream, cheese, tomatoes, or guacamole.</p>",48,21.94,9.63,22.055,276.055,0.079893499,Fajitas,/Images/Dishes/553491d0a9b84db2bb51a4cdf5e76622.png,fajitas,30.27111117,-97.74243651
Tamal,"<p>Tamal is a Mexican dish dating back to the Aztecs, consisting of corn masa dough with a filling that can be either savory or sweet, steamed and wrapped in corn husks, leaves, or banana leaves. The tamales are traditionally accompanied by <em>atole</em>, a masa drink. Even though it is common for Mexican food to be served with a variety of sauces and salsas, tamales are the exception because they are usually eaten plain and simple without any sauces, although it is not a rule set in stone. One of the first records of tamales dates back to the 1550s when the Spaniards were served the dish by the Aztecs who made them with beans, meat, and chiles. Today, the fillings can be anything from beans to chicken, fish, pork, hard cooked eggs, pumpkin seeds or squash. <em>Tamales rojo</em> (red tamales) are filled with shredded meat such as beef or pork in a red chili sauce. <em>Tamales verde</em> (green tamales) have the same meat and a different sauce made from sour, green tomatillos. <em>Tamales dulce</em>, the sweet variety, is filled with dried fruits such as raisins or berries. Hot and flavorful tamales vary by region. In Culiacan and Sinaloa, they like them with sweet brown beans, pineapple, and corn. In Oaxaca, tamales are drizzled with the regional speciality called <em>black mole</em>, and in Yucatan, there is a variety with a filling consisting of chicken, tomato, and achiote. Whatever the variety, tamales have a special place in the colorful Mexican cuisine and culture.</p>",48,24.94866667,9.621333333,7.727333333,224,0.034497024,Tamal,/Images/Dishes/dce13aa4097d4c3bae031b5a718549f3.png,tamal,19.43284709,-99.1313979
Naan,"<p>Naan is a unique and popular flatbread with a chewy texture that has its roots in India. The first documented traces of naan are found in the 1300 AD notes of Amir Kushrau, an Indo-Persian poet. Its name comes from the Persian word for bread. Naan was originally made in two versions at the Imperial Court in Delhi - <em>naan-e-tunuk</em> (light bread) and <em>naan-e-tanuri</em> (baked on the stone walls of a tandoor oven). It consists of white flour, yeast, eggs, milk, salt, and sugar, baked in a tandoor oven. Its typical tear-drop shape is achieved by the way the dough droops as it cooks on the tandoor walls. Many Indian villages had a communal tandoor, placed in the middle of the village so that all the locals could bake naan. There are also many varieties of naan, such as <em>kulcha</em> (the flatbread is stuffed with a filling of nuts and raisins, potatoes, or onions) and <em>garlic naan</em>, topped with butter and crushed garlic. Traditionally, naan is served hot from the oven, slightly charred, brushed with ghee - Indian clarified butter, and it is usually consumed as an accompaniment to a variety of dishes.</p>",47,44.70984211,4.588684211,6.055684211,253.8578947,0.023854622,Naan,/images/dishes/f725824c3c924c85abc45084c95c982f.png,naan,28.60881815,77.21318424
Pad Thai,"<p>Pad Thai is Thailand's national dish, a flavorful stir-fry (<em>pad</em> in Thai) dish consisting of rice noodles, tofu, dried shrimp, bean sprouts, and eggs. If it's made with meat, chicken and pork are some of the most popular choices. The flavors are an intricate combination of sweet, sour, and salty, with a well-balanced contrast of textures. Pad Thai is probably one of the most popular Thai dishes abroad. Its origins can be traced to a period of nationalism in the country, after the 1932 revolution that ended the absolute monarchy. There was a public contest to find a new national noodle dish, and the winner was a Pad Thai consisting of noodles, radish, sprouts, peanuts, and eggs. Tender rice noodles are additionally flavored with sugar, tamarind, lime juice, vinegar, and fish sauce, and the dish is traditionally served with ground red chilis, white vinegar, sugar, fresh lime wedges, and fish sauce on the side, so each consumer can garnish the meal to their preference.</p>",47,58.79965,16.38593333,19.35399444,465.6332778,0.041564887,Pad Thai,/Images/Dishes/2c84eb3515b04efebb125f2c7d6221e7.png,pad-thai,13.75149496,100.5000702
Baguette,"<p>Probably the most iconic image of France, this long, light, airy bread with its characteristically crispy crust dates back to the 19th century, when wheat and white breads were no longer a privilege of the rich. Baguettes were made even before the invention of their name. The word baguette first entered use in 1920, derived from the Latin root <em>baculum</em>, meaning <em>stick</em> or <em>staff</em>, which became <em>baccheto</em> in Italian. Baguettes were first baked as long, wide loaves of bread, but a 1920 law prevented workers from beginning work before 4AM, making it impossible for bakers to finish baking the bread in time for breakfast. They then gave baguettes their typical long, thin shape in order to speed up the baking process. The bread was baked in steam ovens, which were first brought to Paris by an Austrian named August Zang, whom some French sources credit with the invention of the baguette. Another characteristic of the baguette is its typical flower-petal design on the top of the crust, made by making diagonal slashes with a curved knife on top of the loaves before they are put to bake. Today, baguettes can be found throughout France, and they are available for sale in nearly every boulangerie, as well as baked at home. The texture and flavor of a good baguette can transform any sandwich into a gourmet meal. Baguettes are also flexible &ndash; they can be made into bruschettas, turned into croutons or garlic bread, used for mopping up sauces, or simply dipped in olive oil as a snack.</p>",47,45.87655,3.26104,9.397,256.864,0.036583562,Baguette,/Images/Dishes/b4b5c1007fd04e4ab692d0aee66c8ad4.png,baguette,48.86701344,2.333387699
Ceviche,"<p>Ceviche is the national dish of Peru consisting of slices of raw fish or shellfish that is spiced with salt, onions, and chili peppers, then marinated in lime juice. Due to the acidity of lime juice, the texture of the fish changes, as does its color &ndash; from pink to white. The acidic marinade, also known as<em> leche de tigre</em> (lit. tiger's milk) ""cooks"" the meat without any heat involved in the process. For ceviche, fresh fish is an imperative, as fish and shellfish that are not fresh can cause food poisoning. Peruvians are used to fresh ingredients, so the fish will sometimes be prepared for ceviche less than an hour after being caught. Fish for ceviche can be divided into three categories: firm, medium, and soft. The dish was originally made by the natives who marinated fish and <em>amarillo</em> chiles in the juices of a native fruit called <em>tumbo</em>, which was replaced by lime juice when the Spanish brought limes and onions to the country. The flavors of ceviche are slightly acidic and spicy, with an intense aroma of the sea. Traditionally, it is served on a bed of lettuce with tiny pieces of corn, chunks of sweet potato, and boiled yuca. <em>Cancha</em>, a variety of popcorn made from large corn kernels toasted in salt and oil provides an ideal side dish. The dish is traditionally served at <em>cevicherias</em>, specialized ceviche restaurants that can be found all over the country, and it is so popular that it even has its day, known as National Ceviche Day.</p>",47,11.823485,3.10769,19.26772,155.284425,0.124080184,Ceviche,/Images/Dishes/41411a8196774ca190e77e122e27ce1c.png,ceviche,-12.0629224,-77.03650925
Pasta carbonara,"<p>The carbonara we know today is prepared by simply tossing spaghetti with <em>guanciale</em> (cured pork jowl), egg yolks, and Pecorino Romano cheese. Despite its simplicity, this dish remains one of Rome's favorites, equally popular throughout the country. Even though carbonara is considered a typical Roman dish today, its origins are quite vague and often disputed. The name is said to have been derived from the <em>carbonari</em>, woodcutters and charcoal-makers who lived in the Appenine mountains northeast of Rome, and who supposedly cooked their pasta over a hardwood charcoal fire and tossed it with eggs and cheese. Another popular theory claims that carbonara was invented after the liberation of Rome in 1944, when food shortages were so severe that Allied troops distributed bacon and powdered eggs, which the local population would then mix with water to make pasta sauce.</p>",47,37.291,10.0065,13.024,318.15,0.040936665,Pasta carbonara,/Images/Dishes/7c0ff563d8bd41fb85400b0b4d8b04d3.png,carbonara,41.89600072,12.48496946
Guacamole,"<p>Guacamole is a world-famous buttery delicacy dating back all the way to the Aztec empire of the 1500s. It&rsquo;s a healthy blend of ripe, mashed avocados, onions, chiles, optional tomatoes and selected seasonings such as sea salt and coriander. The star of this incredibly simple dish is the avocado, high in unsaturated fat, potassium, vitamins, minerals and protein, its name stemming from the Aztec <em>ahuacatl</em>, meaning <em>testicle</em> or <em>testicle tree</em>, which is why it was believed that it was an aphrodisiac by the Aztecs. Guacamole is sometimes prepared in the <em>molcajete</em>, a traditional Mexican mortar and pestle where onions, chiles, and salt are ground to a paste and added to the coarsely mashed avocados. Of course, guacamole is only as good as the avocados it is prepared with, and among the best are the nutty and creamy <em>Hass</em> and smooth <em>Fuerte</em> avocados. It is usually accompanied by corn chips, nachos or tortillas on the side, so guacamole is used as a side dish or a dip. Regardless of its position on the table, the only important thing is to serve it fresh before it oxidizes and changes its vivid, green color to a darker brown hue.</p>",47,3.90059,7.87165,0.95927,87.9131,0.010911571,Guacamole,/images/dishes/4c2ac77cdc4944268749bc4425f5556b.png,guacamole,19.43213057,-99.13158861
Sundae,"<p>Along with <em>Banana Split</em>, sundae is one of the most served ice cream-based desserts in the United States of America. A sundae is ice cream topped with a sauce or syrup, typically served in a bowl. The most popular varieties of sundae are chocolate caramel, butterscotch, and strawberry. Cherries, dairy cream, and nuts are the most common additions to the popular treat. Food historians still argue about the origin of the ice cream sundae, but there are three theories which remain the most popular. The first one says it was created in Illinois, where the law prohibited the selling of soda water on a Sunday. As an alternative, local soda fountains started selling ice cream sodas without the soda, leaving the customers with only syrup and ice cream, known as sundaes. The second theory says that it was invented in Wisconsin by a soda fountain owner named Ed Berners, who served ice cream topped with syrup used for sodas to his customers. Berners loved the dish and charged a nickel for it. His competitor, George Giffy, started to serve the dessert on Sundays. Once he started to make money, he changed the name from Ice Cream Sunday to Ice Cream Sundae and served it every day of the week. The last theory suggests that the sundae was first made in Ithaca, New York by Chester Platt, a drugstore owner who served a dish of vanilla ice cream, cherry syrup, and candied cherries to one Reverend John Scott, and he named the dish after the day. Regardless of its inventor, today there are over hundred types of sundaes, offered in numerous flavors such as pineapple, blueberry, banana, raspberry, or marshmallow, among others.</p>",47,43.030275,12.49845,6.070025,311.39,0.01949332,Sundae,/Images/Dishes/8a1b12eac25447a78e579b241008d480.png,sundae,38.89518465,-77.03539109
Quesadilla,"<p>Quesadilla is a simple Mexican snack consisting of a flour or corn tortilla filled with cheese that melts well. It is commonly folded in half and consumed. A quesadilla can also have some other ingredients on the inside such as meats, beans, or potatoes, but cheese is always mandatory (with the exception of Mexico City, where cheese in a quesadilla is often an afterthought). Sometimes, it is cut into wedges and served with salsa or guacamole on the side, and it can be topped with vegetables such as diced tomatoes, onions, lettuce, or hot chiles. The origins of quesadilla are somewhat murky, but it is known that the cheese was brought to Mexico by the Spaniards along with other dairy products in colonial times, and the thin flatbreads were already a staple of the Mesoamerican people. The Spaniards named the dish quesadilla (<em>little cheesy thing</em>). In northern Mexico, and parts of the southwestern United States, flour tortillas are more common than corn tortillas, so quesadillas with flour tortillas started to gain popularity throughout the United States as well. Today, there are numerous varieties and fillings for quesadillas such as chorizo, Oaxaca cheese, epazote, and squash blossoms.</p>",46,44.36787778,29.02188333,33.45975,638.9311111,0.052368322,Quesadilla,/Images/Dishes/8e2ed5d4da6e4952aa3af3cce76a6892.png,quesadilla,19.43544456,-99.13228462
Afternoon Tea,"<p>Afternoon tea is an old British tradition of having tea between 3 and 5 o'clock in the afternoon, accompanied by sweet or savory tidbits of food. There are three types of afternoon tea: <em>cream tea</em>, paired with scones, jam, and cream; <em>light tea</em>, paired with scones and sweets; and <em>full tea</em>, paired with savories, scones, sweets, and a dessert. It is said that the tradition was invented by Anna Maria Stanhope, the Duchess of Bedford, in the 19th century. She suffered from a <em>""</em>sinking feeling<em>""</em> in the afternoon, so she started having a pot of tea and a light snack privately in her boudoir. Later on, she began inviting her friends to join her, and shortly after, all of the fashionable society at the time was drinking tea and snacking on sandwiches in the middle of the afternoon. There are some rules concerning the traditional afternoon tea; it should be served with milk after the tea is in the cup, the tea should be sipped, not slurped, and the teaspoon should never be left in the cup, especially while drinking tea. Today, afternoon tea is an occasional luxury or a birthday treat in a fancy hotel, and it is less associated with high society, since people in the United Kingdom tend to consume it multiple times a day, in numerous ways and flavors.</p>",46,21.295,9.7,4.22,200.4083333,0.021057009,Afternoon Tea,/Images/Dishes/247151ea962542b2944c67bcd1bf3396.png,afternoon-tea,51.5061782,-0.126342773
Fish and Chips,"<p>Most Brits would agree that there is nothing more British than fish and chips. This comforting, widely loved national dish consists of a freshly fried, hot, white fish fillet and large, sliced and fried potatoes. Cod, haddock, and flounder are the most common types of fish that is fried for the dish, and the customers can choose which type of fish they want, with cod being the most popular choice. The fillets get dipped in a batter made from eggs, milk, and flour, and are then fried in oil, lard, or beef drippings along with the potatoes. The origins of this dish go back to the 17th century, when potatoes were fried as a substitute for fish in the winter months, while fried fish was introduced into the country by Jewish refugees. Fish and chips are a favorite takeaway dish, with numerous <em>chippies</em> (fish and chips shops) popping up all over the country and offering a few accompaniments and sides, such as salt, vinegar, mushy peas, curry sauce, ketchup, brown sauce, and a cup of sweet, milky tea. Traditionally, the dish is served wrapped in greaseproof paper and a layer of newspaper in order to make eating outside easier, and if you want to do as the Brits do, it is the only acceptable way to eat it.</p>",46,45.3918,20.89753684,20.05429474,454.28,0.044145229,Fish and Chips,/Images/Dishes/4c03880526bf47129c76b92071c1dd1e.png,fish-and-chips,51.50722838,-0.126447704
Chutney,"<p>Whether Indians are enjoying tandoori chicken or aloo paratha, no meal is complete without the flavorful chutneys - India's national condiments. These fresh homemade relishes consist of pickled or stewed fruit and vegetables that are cut into small chunks, then delicately seasoned with a variety of spices such as cumin, cardamom, tamarind, ginger, and turmeric. They are typically served in small, round bowls and consumed along with the main dish. Chutney's role is to cool the palate and bring even more flavors and colors to the table. Most families take great pride in their homemade chutneys, their houses decorated with rows upon rows of jars that were left to mature in the sun on windowsills. It is common to serve more than one chutney, so a hostess is often judged by the number and variety of chutneys she serves to her guests. <em>Mint chutney</em> is the most popular variety, traditionally eaten with samosas and consisting of fresh mint leaves, onions, garlic, and lemon juice. <em>Coconut chutney</em>, another favorite, consists of grated coconut, ginger, kari leaves, chiles, and garlic. Other types of chutney can be made with green mangoes, tomatoes, sour cherries, coriander, peanut, and apples, all of them with vivid colors, sweet, spicy, and sour at the same time. Chutney got its name from an Anglicized version of the Sanskrit word <em>chatni</em>, which literally translates to <em>licking good</em>, and it is obvious to anyone who tried it that it lives up to its name.</p>",46,5.923175,1.094475,0.3281875,33.82949375,0.009701224,Chutney,/Images/Dishes/9488655608f34ebca6f10e404c68c217.png,chutney,28.61290326,77.21783199
Churrasco,"<p>Churrasco is a Brazilian barbecue method where juicy pieces, slices, steaks, and chops of beef, veal, lamb, pork, and chicken are placed on big skewers and grilled over wood fire. It started in the early 1800s when the Gauchos (European immigrants that settled in the Rio Grade do Sul area) would get together and start a fire, adding large portions of meat on skewers and slowly grilling the meat. In the restaurants, known as <em>churrascarias</em>, the skewers are paraded across the restaurant in a flashy manner, and the waiters circulate among the tables in order to show off the succulent meat to hungry diners. After the customers have chosen their preferred type of meat, it is sliced off the skewers to the dining plates. Also known as <em>rod&iacute;zio</em>, the theme of this barbecue experience is <em>all you can eat</em>, so the customers should know to come with an empty stomach. Beef is the most popular option, although livers and hearts are especially rich and chewy. In Brazil, the meat will often be from the <em>zebu</em>, a succulent, lean breed of cattle with a hump that's especially popular in churrasco as a cut of meat called <em>cupim</em>. Churrasco starts with appetizers and a variety of salads offered from a big buffet, as a preview of things to come. The usual accompaniments for the meat include farofa grains, rice, fried potatoes, potato salad, steamed greens, black beans, onions, fried bananas, and numerous chili-based sauces. After the big meal, it is typical to consume grilled pineapple slices, serving as a palate cleanser as well as a tasty dessert. Churrasco (lit. barbecue) is also popular as a cooking method in countries such as Nicaragua, Puerto Rico, Argentina, Uruguay, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Chile, and each country has their own favorite cuts of meat and accompaniments for this popular barbecue style.</p>",46,2.009333333,10.654,16.20633333,172.6933333,0.09384458,Churrasco,/images/dishes/d82b1939575b4c8b90ef903e04f12ae2.png,churrasco,-30.03339373,-51.23309358
??clair,"<p>These elongated pastries with an appealing glaze, a crispy exterior, a soft doughy interior, and a sweet, creamy center originated in France at the turn of the 20th century. Most food historians believe they were invented by Marie-Antoine Car&ecirc;me, a famous French chef. &Eacute;clairs (French for <em>lightning</em>) are believed to have received their name because of how the light would reflect off of them after a coating of confectioner&rsquo;s glaze. The oldest recipe for these tasty treats can be found in the <em>Boston Cooking School Cook Book</em>, published in 1884. Today, &eacute;clairs are becoming increasingly popular in France and throughout the world, and have begun to sport new fillings such as green tea and lemon cream.</p>",45,21.25535,11.01545,5.9804,206.4975,0.028961125,??clair,/Images/Dishes/7eabf70c83ea45c2ae8a3d0c607e6555.png,eclair,48.85549917,2.351082689
B??rek,"<p>B&ouml;rek is a baked dish consisting of a savory or sweet filling wrapped in <em>yufka</em> - thinly stretched sheets of dough made with flour, water, and salt. Heartier than phyllo, but thinner than a tortilla, hand-made yufka is typically brushed with butter before baking. Although many countries have their own versions of this satisfying dish, it was probably invented during the Ottoman Empire in the Anatolian Provinces, an area that nowadays belongs to Turkey. Some sources suggest that b&ouml;rek might be even older, a descendant of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Anatolian dish known as <em>en tyritas plakountas</em>, consisting of layered dough filled with cheese, its recipe dating back to 160 BC. Nowadays, Turkey is famous for its layered pies and pastries, all united under the name b&ouml;rek (also <em>burek, byurek, byrek, b&ouml;regi</em>). Regardless of many b&ouml;rek varieties, yufka always remains the same, and almost everything wrapped in it may be called b&ouml;rek, which could also explain the name: some suggest that it comes from the Turkish word <em>bur</em>, meaning <em>to twist</em>. In Turkey, there are many regional variations of b&ouml;rek, and the names usually contain a descriptive word referring to the shape, ingredients, cooking method, or a region where the specific variety of b&ouml;rek comes from. For example, <em>su b&ouml;re??i</em> or <em>water b&ouml;rek</em> is made with boiled sheets of dough which are buttered and filled with a mixture of feta cheese and parsley (an alternative recipe suggests minced meat and onions), then baked. <em>Kalem b&ouml;regi</em> or <em>pen b&ouml;rek</em> is a thin, cigarette-shaped variety that is often served in restaurants as an appetizer. Due to their shape, they were originally called <em>sigara b&ouml;re??i</em>, but in 2011, Turkish pastry chefs started calling them <em>kalem</em> to avoid the connections with smoking. They are usually filled with feta cheese, potatoes, and parsley, but can also be enriched with minced meat or sausages, and vegetables such as spinach, nettles, leeks, and courgettes. <em>Pa&ccedil;anga b&ouml;re??</em>i is a deep-fried variety from Istanbul, filled with past??rma or ka??ar and chopped green peppers. <em>Saray b&ouml;re??i</em> or <em>palace b&ouml;rek</em> is a truly decadent version made with fresh butter rolled between each sheet of dough, while <em>kol b&ouml;re??i</em> or <em>arm b&ouml;rek</em> is the classic variety prepared at home - shaped in long rolls, either rounded or lined, it is usually filled with minced meat, feta cheese, spinach, or potatoes (it's smaller and fattier variety is called <em>sar??yer b&ouml;re??i</em>, named after Sar??yer, a district of Istanbul where it is traditionally prepared). The most beautiful variety might be <em>g&uuml;l b&ouml;re??i</em> or <em>rose b&ouml;rek</em>, arranged in a spiral that resembles a rose filled with various fillings which are often spicy in flavor. <em>&Ccedil;i?? b&ouml;rek</em> or <em>raw b&ouml;rek</em> is a half-moon-shaped variety filled with raw minced meat and fried in oil. On the other hand, there is also <em>t&ouml;b&ouml;rek</em> - a similar variety which is baked instead of fried. However, b&ouml;rek doesn't have to be savory - a sweet variety called <em>laz b&ouml;re??i</em> is prepared in the Rize region. It is filled with <em>muhallebi</em> (a local spin on custard) and served generously dusted with powdered sugar. Another sweet variety is called <em>k&uuml;rt b&ouml;re??i</em>, also known as <em>sade</em>, meaning <em>plain b&ouml;rek</em>, referring to the fact that it has no filling at all, just a generous layer of powdered sugar on top. Seeing all these varieties, it is clear that b&ouml;rek may be one of the most significant dishes of the Turkish cuisine &ndash; it surely is one of the oldest and most traditional ones.</p>",45,43.81766667,18.11611111,12.04666667,426.5555556,0.02824173,B??rek,/images/dishes/3a73a75751f24111b5aa096c5a530514.png,borek,39.9220144,32.85521274
Fondue,"<p>Fondue is Switzerland's national dish, a melting pot of different flavors and aromas, similar to the country itself&ndash;a melting pot of people and different cultures. Its name comes from the French word <em>fondre</em>, meaning <em>to melt</em>, and it was first described in Homer's <em>Iliad</em> as a mixture of goat cheese, flour, and wine. Fondue's key ingredient is cheese that is melted over a fire, with a lot of regional varieties and flavorful additions such as cherry brandy, white wine, or a sprinkle of nutmeg. It was invented out of necessity, when the alpine locals and traveling herders relied only on cheese, wine, and bread to get them through the winter. As the summer cheese dried out and bread became stale during the winter months, the people started to melt cheese with wine and dip pieces of stale bread into it. Traditionally, fondue is prepared in a flameproof casserole called a <em>caquelon</em>. The dish varies from region to region: <em>fondue Neuchatel</em> uses Gruy&eacute;re and Emmental, <em>fondue Vandois</em> adds a lot of garlic, while <em>fondue Fribourg</em> is prepared with ripe <em>Vacherin</em> cheese. Pieces of bread are placed on traditional, long-handled fondue forks used for swirling the bread in cheese. According to local customs, if one loses a piece of bread in the pot, he or she has to buy a round of drinks for everyone involved in this unique and cheesy communal affair.</p>",45,7.82104,18.329675,17.67797,288.59965,0.061254302,Fondue,/Images/Dishes/a8b9eda263de45428251f7e31f5636bf.png,fondue,46.94786095,7.452442389
Churros,"<p>Elongated, crispy, crunchy and intensely fragrant, churros consist of deep-fried yeast dough encrusted with sugar. Although some may argue against consuming these sweet treats, warning others about the dangerous effects of sugar and fat on human bodies, the popularity of churros throughout the world doesn't seem to wane. Originally invented by Spanish shepherds who could easily cook them in a pan over an open fire, today these unusually shaped, cinnamon sugar sprinkled twists are most commonly eaten in Spain and Latin America as a hot breakfast food, accompanied by a strong cup of coffee or a cup of thick hot chocolate. Their characteristical shape is achieved by pressing the dough through plastic tubes so it emerges on the other side in thin, ridged ropes. Although churros are a Madrid specialty, the ones found in Seville are often praised because they differ in a lighter and more delicate texture. In Cuba, they may be filled with guava, in Mexico with dulce de leche, and in Uruguay with cheese. Regardless of the varieties, churros are an indulgence that must be tried at least once.</p>",45,31.39444444,10.375,3.667222222,230.9055556,0.015881914,Churros,/Images/Dishes/c4200405b62d4c3db1836bd2d00c1905.png,churros,40.41659845,-3.701184707
Shabu-shabu,"<p>Shabu-shabu is a popular Japanese dish consisting of thinly sliced meat and vegetables cooked in water. The dish is an evolved version of the traditional Mongolian <em>nabemono</em> (one-pot) cooking. Roughly translated to <em>swish-swish</em>, its name is referring to the sound that is made when the sliced pieces of meat go through the water. Although beef is the most popular choice of meat, shabu-shabu can also be prepared with lamb, chicken, pork, duck, crab, or lobster. Steamed rice and a variety of sauces are often served on the side, accompanying the main dish. The dish is typically shared and eaten communally, each consumer dipping a slice of meat in the central pot that is filled with boiling water. Although shabu-shabu originates from China, it was popularized during the 20th century in Osaka, Japan.</p>",44,26.46153125,13.944425,25.48608125,326.402625,0.078081729,Shabu-shabu,/Images/Dishes/7ef0d99937ff4fb7822493a78e829613.png,shabu-shabu,34.75003501,135.460145
Parfait,"<p>The name of this partially frozen French dessert means <em>perfect</em> &ndash; so one can imagine that its creators intended the experience of eating it to be no less thrilling than its name implies. Parfait is a frozen dessert made from a base of egg yolks, sugar, and whipped cream, and it can be flavored with any number of additional ingredients such as fruit, nuts, or coffee. Today, however, parfaits can be made with savory ingredients as well, and there are versions made with seafood, vegetables, and even foie gras. Parfaits were originally served on decorative plates, but today they are usually layered in tall and thin flute glasses. The dessert is so popular that it even has its own holiday in the US &ndash; National Parfait Day &ndash; which is celebrated on November 25th.</p>",44,42.81157,5.470245,7.51032,256.608,0.029267677,Parfait,/Images/Dishes/e2144280ecef420882485f29604170bf.png,parfait,48.85652348,2.347802019
Miso Soup,"<p>Miso soup is a traditional Japanese soy-based soup made from a stock called <em>dashi</em>, miso paste, and various additional ingredients such as seaweed or tofu. It is estimated that more than 70% of Japeanese people consume the soup for breakfast, although it is commonly available at any time of the day. In Japanese restaurants in the United States, miso soup is often offered as an appetizer. The soup is thought to have medicinal properties, as it alkalizes the blood and revives the nervous system. The main ingredient is called miso - a combination of rice, salt, water, and fermented soybeans, shaped into a paste that is similar to peanut butter in texture. Miso is centuries old, and its roots are in <em>chiang</em> - a fermented soybean paste invented in China by Buddhist priests more than 2500 years ago. Since miso soup is relatively quick and easy to prepare, in Japan, there are even instant cups of the soup available in vending machines for a small amount of money, acting as a testament to the soup's enormous popularity.</p>",43,5.727272222,1.3496,2.734738889,42.09183889,0.064970763,Miso Soup,/Images/Dishes/9fa39757c5154781a27beaac95736c99.png,miso-soup,35.68134818,139.7595261
Dondurma,"<p>Turkish ice cream is believed to originate from the city of Mara??&mdash;hence the name&mdash;and what really sets it apart from other varieties is its resistance to melting and a particularly dense, chewy texture. These qualities are brought by adding two thickening agents to the basic milk and sugar mixture: Arab gum, also known as mastic resin, and <em>salep</em>&mdash;a type of flour made from the root of the early purple orchid. In fact, in the Kahramanmara?? region, ice cream typically contains distinctly more salep than usual, which is why it is sometimes called <em>kesme dondurma</em>&mdash;from the Turkish <em>kesmek</em>, meaning <em>to cut</em>&mdash;which is the reason why this ice cream variety is usually eaten with a knife and fork. In Turkey, ice cream is commonly sold in the streets but also in specialized <em>dondurmas??</em> shops, whose owners will often go out of their way by producing their own salep, apart from using exclusively natural flavorings and milk from goats fed only with thyme, orchid flowers, and <em>milkvetch</em>.</p>",43,20.105,7.3275,2.8015,162.6,0.017229397,Dondurma,/images/dishes/b75a6d14107d4405a616ed417ec2a89e.png,maras-dondurmas,37.5870465,36.90358338
Apple Pie,"<p>Although England has a long history of making meat and fruit pies, and it was the inspiration for the American versions, there is nothing that is more synonymous with American desserts than the apple pie. In the United States, apple pies are found everywhere from big grocery shops and restaurants to coffee shops and home bakers, baked until the double crust is golden brown, filled with cinnamon-sugar coated apples. Homemade American apple pie is a source of great pride, causing arguments about which apple variety is the most suitable for the best pies. Some swear by <em>Granny Smiths</em>, but they are sour and require too much sugar, resulting in a soggy crust. Others prefer <em>Golden Delicious</em>, the driest, but the least flavorful variety. Experts opt for the tart <em>Cortland</em> or the flavorful <em>Northern Spy</em> varieties, both at their prime between September and November. However, apple varieties are not the only concern. What about the crust? Should it be flaky and buttery or thin, crispy and based on lard? For a sweet and savory combination, some even replace half of the butter with Cheddar cheese, resulting in an unusual apple pie with a cheesy crust. The most popular variety in the US is probably <em>apple pie &agrave; la mode</em>, invented in Minnesota in 1885, and served with a scoop of ice cream on top. Regardless of the regional varieties and endless debates, apple pie is an American dessert like no other, best paired with a sweet Riesling wine.</p>",42,47.35394211,16.29829474,4.319389474,320.5970526,0.013472954,Apple Pie,/images/dishes/4585252c1cb34395b37d55c03242d5e1.png,apple-pie,38.89529574,-77.03724659
Grilled Cheese,"<p>Grilled cheese is a classic American sandwich that is usually prepared with one or more cheese varieties that are placed between two slices of bread. The slices are buttered from the outside, and the sandwich is then shortly heated, typically in a pan or on a griddle, until the bread is golden and the cheese melts. Although cheese and bread were a common pairing since the early 1900s, and the French have their own, similar <em>Croque Monsieur</em> sandwich, <em>grilled cheese</em> sandwich first appeared in the United States in the 1920s, when it was prepared open-faced, as a slice of bread topped with shredded cheese. It rose in popularity due to the fact that it was inexpensive and affordable. In the 1960s, a second slice of bread was added on top, and the classic grilled cheese as we know today was invented, due to the availability of pre-sliced bread and processed cheese singles. Today, the sandwich has evolved into various creations, as innovators started serving it on bagels, adding different kinds of cheese, meat, and vegetables such as bacon, tomatoes, and avocado into it. Grilled cheese still remains a staple of comfort food and the children's favorite, although it is often consumed by many adults, and it is even served in some high-end restaurants. For many people, there is nothing better than pairing a hot grilled cheese sandwich with a bowl of tomato soup, and it is believed that the comforting combination is best when consumed on a cold, rainy night.</p>",42,36.77563125,22.76286875,18.3189,432.834625,0.042323093,Grilled Cheese,/images/dishes/01de4781ab344d7ea97d1b2d43d9695f.png,grilled-cheese,38.89462874,-77.03575819
Gyros,"<p>Gyros is one of the most popular Greek street food dishes, consisting of meat such as pork and chicken (in Greece) or lamb and veal (popular in other countries) cooked on a vertical spit. The meat is sliced in thin shavings and is then usually placed in a pita bread along with sauces such as <em>tzatziki</em> and vegetables such as tomatoes, onions, lettuce, and cucumbers. Gyros is derived from the Greek word <em>gheereezo</em>, meaning<em> to turn</em>, referring to the constantly rotating vertical spit on which the meat is cooked. Some believe that gyros originated during the time of Alexander the Great, when his soldiers skewered the meat on their swords and cooked it over a fire. Others claim that gyros was introduced to Greece in 1922, with the refugees from Constantinople and Smyrna. Many of the refugees became merchants and opened their shops with tiny holes in the wall, where gyros was sold. After WWII, gyros gained popularity and spread to Europe, Australia, and the United States. Today, gyros is known as one of the most popular street food varieties around the world.</p>",42,8.905,11.02,18.46,220.655,0.083660012,Gyros,/Images/Dishes/5c0c797b7dd04b0ea3700d88e98edabf.png,gyros,37.98302839,23.7312423
Pizza Napoletana,"<p>Italy&rsquo;s most emblematic culinary creation, the genuine pizza Napoletana is made with just a few simple ingredients and prepared in only two variations &ndash; <em>marinara</em>, the basic Neapolitan pizza topped with a tomato-based sauce flavored with garlic and oregano, and <em>margherita</em>, which is topped with tomatoes, mozzarella, and fresh basil leaves, a delicious combination whose colors are said to represent the Italian flag. The crust is very thin at the base, and the dough puffs up on the sides, which results in airy crust that should have typical charred 'leopard spots' if baked properly. The origins of this iconic Neapolitan dish can be traced to the early 1700s, when what we know today as pizza marinara was first described by Italian chef, writer, and philosopher Vincenzo Corrado in his treatise on the eating habits of the people of Naples. Almost 200 years later, in 1889, the premier Neapolitan master pizzaiolo Raffaele Esposito added mozzarella to the mix and invented the margherita, which is now generally cited as the first modern pizza. Originally dubbed <em>la pizza tricolore</em>, Esposito&rsquo;s creation is said to have been made in honor of and named after Margherita of Savoy, the Queen consort of the Kingdom of Italy, who was visiting Naples at the time. In 2010, as one of Italy&rsquo;s most popular foods worldwide, pizza Napoletana was officially recognized by the European Union and granted the designation of Traditional Specialty Guaranteed. And remember, a good pizza Napoletana doesn't need any additions other than the designated toppings.</p>",42,61.26769231,66.93846154,14.28307692,467.6923077,0.030539474,Pizza Napoletana,/images/dishes/7de6337184094547aa43810c68ccbb9d.png,pizza-napoletana,40.84002501,14.245011
Nougat,"<p>This is one of the oldest types of confections, and varieties can be found throughout Italy, Spain, France, the Balkans, and the Middle East. Although each region has its own distinctive type, most nougats are made of whipped egg white mixed with roasted chopped nuts such as almonds, pistachios, walnuts, and hazelnuts. The result is a sweet treat with a chewy consistency. The exact origin of nougat is hard to trace, but the first recipe for a sweet resembling white nougat called <em>natif</em> was recorded in a 10th-century book found in Baghdad. Nougat can be divided into numerous categories, but the most basic distinction is made between soft or hard nougat, depending on whether it is made with honey or sugar. In Italy, nougat is known as <em>torrone</em>, and each city and region has its own traditional type of torrone, ranging from hard versions made with sugar to soft and chewy honey-based varieties. French nougat is predominately made without eggs and with a larger proportion of nuts, while the Spanish usually use roasted almonds and raw honey. Viennese nougat is somewhat different from the other types &ndash;it is made of finely ground cocoa butter, nuts, and cocoa mass, resulting in a soft chocolaty blend that is usually incorporated with other confections. Most traditional nougats are usually eaten on their own as a dessert or sweet snack, and the festive appearance of sliced nougat has earned it a regular place on various regional holiday platters.</p>",42,33.3375,11.2015,3.6025,255.38485,0.014106162,Nougat,/Images/Dishes/5a250c70ce5c4c3ea3fa0f4ea78f9ff7.png,nougat,41.89411685,12.48428312
Chorizo,"<p>Chorizo is a Spanish sausage consisting of chopped pork meat and fat that is seasoned with paprika, and sometimes garlic. The combination of these ingredients is then stuffed into a natural casing. Chorizo is characterized by its red color, due to the usage of special paprika known as <em>pimenton</em>, which is the key ingredient that differentiates the Spanish chorizo from other similar sausages. It has a unique, hearty, and spicy flavor. Different version of chorizo also exist in countries such as Mexico, Puerto Rico, Ecuador, Panama, Argentino, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia, and Uruguay. Some claim that chorizo has origins in the Catalan <em>xori&ccedil;o</em>, while others say that it has roots in <em>morcilla</em>, or blood sausage. Chorizo is a truly versatile sausage, as it can be sliced in a sandwich, fried, grilled, simmered in liquids, or used as a pizza topping.</p>",42,1.866115,33.25798,24.22712,248.0996,0.097650782,Chorizo,/Images/Dishes/6b1192a318c84d0ba1a8ce77fc4a0e99.png,chorizo,40.41614159,-3.696571369
Satay,"<p>Satay is a popular and versatile Indonesian dish. It consists of skewered meat served with a sauce. All types of meat can be used to make satay, even some of the exotic varieties such as crocodile or snake meat, but the essential thing is to marinate the meat before grilling. It is believed that satay originated in the Indonesian region of Java and that it was developed under the influence of Muslim traders who migrated from India. Another theory claims that satay was created in the 19th century by Indonesian street vendors as a variation of Indian kebabs. The theory is supported by the fact that satay became popular when Muslim and Arab immigrants populated those areas. From the moment it originated in Java, satay has quickly spread throughout Southeast Asia, and eventually all over the world. The popularity of satay resulted in a number of varieties of the dish. In Indonesia, it has become a national dish and nowadays it can be found everywhere, from street vendors to high-class restaurants. The most common sauces served with satay are peanut, soy, or pineapple sauce.</p>",42,10.89183158,9.401031579,12.53017368,183.3689105,0.068333141,Satay,/Images/Dishes/a7f53e69efe24e6484abb72dae77e866.png,satay,-6.175449759,106.8280261
Mousse au chocolat,"<p>This classic French dessert is made with dark chocolate, eggs, butter, sugar, and salt. It is characterized by its foamy, bubbly texture and rich chocolate flavor. Its origins, however, are still relatively unknown. The French have been cooking with chocolate since the 17th century, when it was introduced to France by the Spaniards. Mousse originated in the 18th century as a cooking technique, so it was only a matter of time until the French started using chocolate in the preparation of mousse. Today, mousse au chocolat is commonly decorated with flakes or chunks of chocolate on top, adding contrast to the flavor and smooth texture of the mousse. Mint leaves, cream, raspberries, or strawberries are also commonly used as eye-catching and delicious decorations for this classic, decadent French dessert.</p>",42,17.925,9.585,4.7595,179.55,0.026507937,Mousse au chocolat,/images/dishes/0bc5fffac7144022b9d6593cb1062ff1.png,mousse-au-chocolat,48.85772803,2.351584996
Bruschetta,"<p>In its simplest form, this classic Italian appetizer consists of a grilled slice of bread rubbed with garlic and drizzled with extra virgin olive oil. According to Marcella Hazan, a cookery writer and one of the foremost authorities on Italian cuisine, the history of bruschetta dates back to ancient Rome &ndash; its name stems from the old Latin bruscare (meaning &ldquo;to roast over coals&rdquo;). Once merely a snack of Italian farmers and olive pickers, the versatile bruschetta has grown into one of the most delicious antipasti Italian cuisine has to offer. While the original Roman bruschetta is flavored with only garlic and olive oil, both the Tuscan fettunta and Calabrian fedda ruscia are typically topped with chopped tomatoes, fresh basil, and sprinkled with either wild fennel seeds or oregano. Nowadays, bruschetta comes in virtually infinite varieties: spread with bell pepper, mushroom, eggplant, or zucchini p&acirc;t&eacute;s, and topped with small chunks of eggplant, figs, scamorza cheese, mozzarella, or even anchovies, prosciutto, or various types of salami. However, even though it might seem that there isn&rsquo;t much to this simple grilled bread appetizer, the secret to a perfect bruschetta is in its simplicity, and the delicate combination of garlic and olive oil shouldn&rsquo;t be overpowered with other flavors.</p>",42,18.03818889,7.761177778,5.904138889,168.8155778,0.034973899,Bruschetta,/Images/Dishes/caabd3c4734b4a3a929601a5534fa981.png,bruschetta,41.89313398,12.48411191
Pommes frites,"<p>There are not many dishes in the world that have risen to the popularity of pommes frites. Originally invented in Belgium, this simple dish is made out of potatoes that are cut into lengthwise strips and deep-fried in hot oil. Although there is some rivalry between France and Belgium concerning the exact origin of pommes frites, the fact is that there is no nation in the world which celebrates and enjoys this dish more than the Belgians. They eat it on a daily basis, as a side dish or as a snack, while pommes frites shops, called <em>frietkots</em> or <em>fritures</em>, can be found throughout the country. Belgian-style pommes frites are freshly prepared, cut into thicker strips and fried on the spot. They are traditionally served in paper cones and accompanied by a generous portion of mayonnaise. Today, a slightly different and more common version of pommes frites is served in fast-food restaurants around the world: the strips are thinner than the traditional kind, and the typical choice for an accompanying condiment is ketchup. Regardless of the variety of condiments, and the way it is served, these tasty fries have long ago established their position as a favorite snack around the globe.</p>",42,29.37368421,7.584210526,3.057368421,205.4736842,0.014879611,Pommes frites,/Images/Dishes/812a2bd27b54473e88a555e86e0d9c1d.png,pommes-frites,50.84659507,4.351345541
Pavlova,"<p>Delicate as the ballerina it was named after, Pavlova is the quintessential summer dessert. Whipped cream is typically dolloped on top of a snowy meringue, followed by a pop of color in the form of fruit, preferably the tart varieties which contrast the sweetness of the meringue. Research suggests Pavlova is a descendant of the German <em>torte</em> and was invented in the 1920s during Anna Pavlova's tour of Australia and New Zealand, although the exact inventor is still debated. The first recipe for Pavlova appeared in print in 1926, although it was not the dessert we know today, but was instead a multi-colored gelatine dish. The base of the cake is prepared almost identically as any meringue, by beating egg whites stiffly, then incorporating sugar, vinegar, and cornstarch. Traditional toppings include whipped cream or lemon curd, and the dessert is often prepared during Christmastime.</p>",42,27.20832632,5.877478947,2.210663158,176.7705789,0.012505832,Pavlova,/Images/Dishes/abf041efa6124365b25481d03b65c46a.png,pavlova,-41.29088783,174.7979751
Souffl??,"<p>This wildly popular French dessert is beloved all over the world &ndash; known to gourmets for its soft, airy texture, and infamous among chefs for its unforgiving nature, which leaves little to no room for error during the cooking process. This delicate cake consists of two elements: a pudding or cream base, and a meringue made of egg whites. Souffl&eacute;s can be either sweet or savory. Sweet souffl&eacute;s typically have a sauce in the middle, and are served almost exclusively as a dessert. Savory souffl&eacute;s often include ingredients such as cheese, crab, or onions, and they are usually served as an appetizer. The dish received its name from the French word <em>souffler</em>, meaning <em>to puff up</em>, and both sweet and savory versions of this delicacy were first created in 18th-century France. The first recipe for the dish is found in Vincent La Chapelle&rsquo;s 1742 book <em>Le Cuisinier Moderne</em>. Today, there are numerous variations of the dish, containing creative ingredients such as figs, kiwi, chicken, vegetables, broccoli, corn, pineapple, and sweet potato.</p>",41,30.62,14.3165,10.835,277.9,0.038988845,Souffl??,/Images/Dishes/e0aba10ad4cd430a86ee3702f7feff21.png,souffle,48.85694361,2.350799793
Mole,"<p>Mole is a family of rich Mexican sauces and the national dish of the country. The base usually contains Mexican chile peppers which are ground in <em>molcajete</em> - a traditional mortar and pestle made of stone. Other ingredients may vary, so moles can contain vegetables, fruits, spices, herbs, nuts, seeds, masa cornmeal, bread, and even chocolate, which adds earthy notes to the spicier ingredients. Interestingly, the Aztecs called it <em>molli</em>, meaning <em>concoction</em> or <em>mixture</em>. The best-known mole is surely <em>mole</em> <em>poblano</em>, originating from Puebla. In Oaxaca, also known as &ldquo;land of the seven moles&rdquo;, one can find moles verdes (with cilantro), moles rojos (tomatoes, sesame seeds), moles negros (chiles, chocolate, nuts, dried fruits), manchamantel (tomatoes, pineapple, ancho chiles, cinnamon, bananas), orange-red moles (plantains), mole almendrado (almonds), and cacahuate (peanuts). The ingredients used in moles are always ground, blended, then simmered together, and once the rich sauce is done, it&rsquo;s traditionally served over poultry.</p>",41,16.57258333,10.73228333,8.789444444,201.4058333,0.043640466,Mole,/images/dishes/42acc1d91f6948ccb18f352c9867c896.png,mole,19.43247241,-99.13293367
Dal,"<p>This flavorful and highly nutritious national dish of India is especially popular in southern parts of the country, but it can also be found in Nepal, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. Dal is a stew with the main ingredient of black or yellow lentils&mdash;the most consumed ingredients in India&mdash;but it can also be prepared with peas, chickpeas, or mung beans. Inexpensive and easy to make, dal was an ideal food for the working class as it provided lots of energy for a full day of labor. While yellow lentils are most commonly used, black lentils are the most prized variety when making dal. Hulled and split, the slightly nutty lentils are slowly simmered with a variety of spices such as caraway, coriander, onions, garlic, chiles, and ginger until they break apart, and are then mashed into a smooth pur&eacute;e. In the northern Punjab region, black mung beans are among the most popular choices for dal and they are typically cooked with ghee (clarified butter), yogurt, onions, tomatoes, and a variety of spices until the dish develops its distinctive aroma and reaches the desired thickness. There are numerous types of dal, each with a different spice combination and flavors. The dish can be served either as a main meal or as a side, and it is traditionally served over rice, accompanied by naan or other Indian breads.</p>",41,36.989745,4.489055,13.16669,232.03003,0.056745629,Dal,/Images/Dishes/41a3459364d340e299ad66311cc563fb.png,dal,12.97093451,77.59719043
Yakisoba,"<p>Yakisoba is the Japanese variety of fried noodles. Originating from the Chinese <em>chow main</em>, these noodles are usually mixed with a variety of meat and vegetables. Japanese favorites are usually pork, cabbage, onions, and carrots. The most common noodle varieties used in the dish are ramen noodles (made with wheat flour) or soba noodles (made with buckwheat). Although soba noodles did give the name to the dish, the ramen variety is still the most common type used in yakisoba. When the meat and vegetables are stir-fried, and the noodles are fully cooked, a special yakisoba sauce, similar to the thick Worcestershire sauce, is added to complete the dish. Yakisoba noodles are eaten everywhere in Japan, they can be found in restaurants or at traditional food stands, but they are also commonly prepared at home. There are numerous varieties of yakisoba noodles in Japan, and every restaurant, seller, or family has their signature yakisoba recipe. Typically, the noodles are served on a plate alongside different condiments such as fish flakes, mayonnaise, pickled ginger, and ground seaweed. Occasionally, they come in sandwich form, when they are served in a special bun and garnished with pickled ginger and special Japanese mayonnaise.</p>",41,41.886835,10.22328,8.398495,296.67725,0.028308524,Yakisoba,/Images/Dishes/ee17b99afadf47b69a7fa2f78a0319ba.png,yakisoba,35.68137983,139.7633423
Pulled Pork,"<p>Pulled pork is an American barbecue technique of cooking pork meat slowly over low heat, resulting in tender meat that can easily be pulled into small pieces. It is a specialty that originates from the western part of North Carolina, traditionally using shoulder cuts of pork which are dressed with a vinegar, pepper, and tomato sauce. In the eastern part of the state, the whole pig is cooked and pulled, while the sauce usually doesn't contain tomatoes. Over time, it spread throughout the United States, and pulled pork can be found in many variations, ranging from different cuts of meat and cooking times to marinades and sauces. Today, pulled pork is popular throughout the world and is mostly used in a variety of sandwiches, accompanied by fries, baked beans, and tangy sauces.</p>",41,10.64664737,13.29936316,23.40587368,252.1376842,0.092829732,Pulled Pork,/Images/Dishes/0febb94ae7dd4dcd960b070657b5d79c.png,pulled-pork,35.78097065,-78.64147847
Tortas,"<p>Mexican tortas are luscious traditional sandwiches filled with delicious, mostly authentic Mexican ingredients. They are a unique Mexican creation, considering they are served in bread rolls, an ingredient that is not so often associated with Mexico. There are two bread varieties usually incorporated in tortas, the traditional French influenced <em>bolillos</em>, and the similar round <em>teleras</em>, which are an authentic Mexican product from Puebla. The rolls are sliced horizontally, buttered, and stuffed with the most popular Mexican ingredients such as beans, avocados, ham, queso, jalape&ntilde;os, and a myriad of other typical Mexican dishes like fried beef or chicken, shredded beef, roasted pork, and even <em>tamales</em>. Tortas are traditionally served cold, but in the 1960s, the hot, grill-heated varieties started to appear and soon became equally famous. There is not much known about the origin of this hearty sandwich, but it is believed that during the French colonization, French bakers introduced their tradition of baking bread to Mexicans, who modified it and created their popular varieties, which later became a staple of Mexican cuisine. The birthplace of the torta is usually associated with the city of Puebla, the place where traditional <em>telera</em> originated, but the location where they flourished was Mexico City. Although tortas have not been widely recognized outside of Mexico as tacos, burritos, and tortillas, they are a favorite meal eaten throughout the country. Tortas are usually sold at food stalls and small restaurants, popularly called <em>torterias</em>, widespread across Mexican cities. The variations and regionally influenced creations of tortas are endless. The most common ones are <em>cubana</em>, which usually combines at least four meat varieties and two types of cheese; <em>pepito</em>, made with marinated sliced steak; <em>cochinita</em>, made with slowly roasted pork; and <em>agohada</em>, a Guadalajara favorite made with pork and served in tomato sauce.</p>",41,60.718,24.183,9.001,541.605,0.016619123,Tortas,/Images/Dishes/86533e385fbb4ffa8d783ba5f9099c09.png,tortas,19.05322799,-98.20059147
Chow mein,"<p>Although food historians can't really agree on who made the first chow mein and when, this stir-fry dish whose name comes from the Mandarin <em>ch??omi&agrave;n</em> and Taishanese <em>ch??u-m&egrave;ing</em> (lit. fried noodles) had probably originated in Northern China. And even though there are as many varieties of chow mein in China as there are regional cuisines, the method of preparation is basically the same. The noodles are boiled and fried until crispy on the outside but still soft in the middle, then tossed with shredded pieces of meat (chicken, pork, beef or seafood) in a classic stir-fry sauce, which is often flavored with rice wine. Lastly, they are served topped with cabbage, celery, onions, mushrooms, or bean sprout shoots. Brought to the United States by Chinese immigrants in the 1850s, chow mein showed up on the menus of numerous Chinese restaurants not long after the Americans had already gone crazy about chop suey. Soon after, to win over Western palates, chow mein was - like many other foreign foods - heavily Americanized. Over time, it became more of a meat dish with deep-fried egg noodles smothered in thick gravy, having little resemblance to the authentic Chinese chow mein. However, with the culinary trends slowly reversing, people are nowadays turning to more traditional recipes.</p>",40,36.88612222,11.59902778,11.46433889,275.5521111,0.041604976,Chow mein,/Images/Dishes/d2166e128ed24937bdada5a9bdd3ba10.png,chow-mein,39.90288333,116.386655
Tteokbokki,"<p>Tteokbokki is a spicy stir-fried dish that usually consists of cylinder-shaped rice cakes, sweet red chili sauce, and fish cakes. It is considered to be one of the top street food items in Korea, and can usually be bought from street vendors known as <em>pojangmacha</em>. The dish originated during the Joseon Dynasty period, when it was used as a cure, and it was also one of the royal court's dishes. Originally, tteokbokki was called<em> tteok jjim</em>, a braised dish of sliced rice cakes, meat, eggs, and seasonings. Although it was brown in color, today it is red, because the colors changed when gochuang (a spicy chili paste) was introduced in the mid-1900s. What was once a dish for the royals is nowadays one of the cheapest street food dishes in Korea, and recently, there have even been efforts to turn it into a food franchise due to continuous demand for tteokbokki among Korean people.</p>",40,58.604,4.977,6.5135,309.15125,0.021068975,Tteokbokki,/images/dishes/e4d1f9c4a7bd4002b84bf87dcd41558d.png,tteokbokki,37.56668398,126.9789025
Crumble,"<p>Regarded as close cousins of pies, crumbles are simple and hearty baked creations made with sweet or savory ingredients. The sweet varieties usually consist of fruit that is placed on the bottom of the tray and topped with a crumbly mixture of butter, sugar, and flour. The savory variants employ meat or vegetables and use cheese as a replacement for sugar. Ground or chopped nuts and oats are a very common addition to the crumbly topping, which provides a more complex texture of the crispy cover. It is believed that the British crumble originated in the midst of the Second World War when original pie ingredients were hard to come by and were considered a luxury. From its humble beginning, crumble became one of the most popular British dishes, especially in its dessert form. With its rustic appeal, frugal ingredients, and quick preparation, it is one of the most common desserts found on the British Isles. It quickly outgrew the borders of its home location and became a dessert that is commonly eaten in the United States and France. The most common fruits used in a crumble are apples, followed by blueberries, plums, apricots, cherries, peaches, and blackberries. With a scoop of ice cream or warm custard on the side, crumble becomes a decadent, luxurious dish.</p>",40,36.29473684,8.315789474,6.315789474,263.8421053,0.023937762,Crumble,/Images/Dishes/d50e9526b9bc4c249ab6f21c449210af.png,crumble,51.50755795,-0.125499308
Sukiyaki,"<p>Sukiyaki is the Japanese sweet and salty hot-pot meal. It is usually prepared tableside on a portable gas stove, in a traditional shallow iron pan. This popular Japanese dish is usually made with beef, preferably the well-marbled tender cuts. However, some varieties employ pork or even tofu, creating the vegetarian version of the dish. Other ingredients in sukiyaki include sliced Chinese cabbage, mushrooms, leeks, gelatinous konnyaku noodles, and shungiku leaves. All the ingredients are then quickly cooked in a mixture of mirin, soy sauce, and sugar. Sukiyaki is a communal style dish, served in one pot, then shared among a larger group of people. There are two traditional ways hot to prepare sukiyaki, Kansai and Kanto style. Essentially, they differ in the order in which the ingredients are added to the broth. In the Kansai variety, all ingredients are added at the same time, while in the Kanto variety, the meat is cooked before any other ingredients are added. The tradition also suggests that before consumption, every morsel should be dipped into beaten eggs. It is believed that the dish was developed during the Meiji era, which started at the end of 19th century. At that time, Japan opened its borders and foreigners introduced new cooking styles and the tradition of eating meat. Since then, it has become one of the favorite communal style dishes in Japan, commonly shared among larger groups of people.</p>",40,33.73522222,10.94341111,26.98109444,341.884,0.078918857,Sukiyaki,/images/dishes/ad0fbb525b38466ba0098f880fd2eca9.png,sukiyaki,35.68158155,139.7614466
Kimbap,"<p>Often referred to as <em>Korean sushi</em>, kimbap is a Korean dish consisting of seaweed (<em>kim</em>), seasoned rice (<em>bap</em>), and other, optional ingredients that are usually rolled, sliced, and served. Almost anything can be added to the roll, but the most common ingredients are fishcakes, meat, spinach, eggs, and cucumbers. There are several theories about the origin of kimbap. Many believe that it is a Korean take on Japanese sushi. Others say that it is a variation of <em>kimssam</em>, a wrap consisting of rice and seaweed. Regardless of the origins, kimbap remains one of the most popular Korean dishes. There are three main styles of kimbap, and there are numerous variations within each of them. There is traditional kimbap with seaweed, rice, and fillings, <em>French</em> or <em>Nude kimbap</em> with seaweed on the interior and rice on the exterior, and <em>Samgak</em> <em>kimbap</em>, shaped like a triangle and sold in many South Korea's convenience stores.</p>",40,40.79947368,8.963157895,10.70684211,292.7684211,0.036571028,Kimbap,/images/dishes/a28c33599e124dc5aacd91d8b39f9b0d.png,kimbap,37.56579614,126.9825324
Shaobing,"<p>Known as a common snack food in Northern China, shaobing is a type of layered flatbread, typically topped with sesame seeds. It is made with multiple layers of dough brushed with sesame paste and resembles a flattened bread roll. Shaobing originated in the Shandong province, but today it can be found at numerous street stalls throughout the country. In fact, depending on the region, shaobing can be enjoyed in many different ways. In southern China, it is a popular breakfast choice, served with soy milk or tea and often stuffed with sweet fillings such as red bean, black sesame, or <em>jujube</em> (red date) paste. In the North, the Chinese prefer savory fillings: <em>rousong</em> (dried pork meat), <em>char siu</em> (roasted pork), or various stir-fried shredded meats and vegetables. However, considering that the staple crop of Northern China is wheat, shaobing is not only enjoyed as a sandwich but it is often served instead of rice, alongside main meals.</p>",40,47.625,11.4175,10.075,327,0.030810398,Shaobing,/images/dishes/613054dea4684cfeac85d848bf361c42.png,bing,36.64972981,117.1177929
Tteok,"<p>Tteok are traditional Korean rice cakes that are prepared with glutinous or non-glutinous rice. The cakes are incredibly versatile, and although they are mostly sweet and enjoyed as a dessert, some plain varieties can be incorporated into savory dishes. The usual preparation includes steaming, pounding, or kneading the rice until it transforms into a pliable dough which can optionally be enriched with different ingredients and shaped into various forms. The most popular tteok varieties include <em>songpyeon</em>, <em>chapssaltteok</em>, <em>garaetteok</em>, <em>gyeongdan</em>, as well as many more traditional and modern versions. The cakes are a staple at various special occasions in South Korea, but some are also enjoyed as a sweet, everyday dessert.</p>",40,82.7015,4.3115,8.754,404.5374,0.021639532,Tteok,/images/dishes/1c28a23dae444116bcc9953a76f409fe.png,tteok,37.56592179,126.9855873
Barbacoa,"<p>Through history, the word <em>barbacoa</em> has been associated with numerous meanings. The first mention of the word had Caribbean origins, where it referred to a contraption created with a framework of sticks, and a method of preparing ingredients using that ancient appliance. Also, the popular belief is that the word <em>barbecue</em> has its origins in the same word. However, in Mexico, the word refers to a slightly different style of preparing and cooking meat. The traditional Mexican barbacoa methods involved digging a hole in the ground, lining the bottom and the sides of the hole with rocks, and additionally adding a layer of burning wood on top, allowing it to burn slowly and turn into coal. The next step was placing agave leaves on coals, and laying the prepared meat on top of it. The hole would be covered with a tin and firmly sealed with dirt. An additional flame would be lit on top, to keep animals away, and the meat would be left to cook overnight. This Mexican tradition is believed to have its origins in the ancient Mayan and Aztec cultures who used the same technique to cook meat. However, they did not use the word <em>barbacoa</em>, and it stays unclear when did the word referring to the ancient Caribbean creation began to be used to specify this old cooking technique. In some parts of Mexico the words <em>pibil</em>, <em>tatema</em>, and <em>birria</em> are used to describe similar dishes cooked under the ground, but it is believed that they are all styles of the barbacoa technique. The meat that is traditionally employed in the barbacoa are animal heads &ndash; goat and cow being the Mexican favorites. All the parts of the head are consumed in Mexico, and the eyeballs are considered to be the rarest and finest delicacy. Since consumption of animal heads is sometimes frowned upon, modern varieties employ other animal parts prepared using the same technique. Barbacoa is particularly popular in northern Mexico and the southern United States regions, which have been in close contact with Mexican tradition. In recent years, due to health and safety regulations, barbacoa can rarely be found in its traditional form. The holes were replaced by modern pressure cookers, which produce similar, but not identical dishes.</p>",39,28.190165,13.459515,22.96167,327.4134,0.070130514,Barbacoa,/Images/Dishes/e1ac4c046e454af0b78d855575db51b8.png,barbacoa,19.43192747,-99.13313869
Bisque,"<p>This thick, creamy, and rich pur&eacute;ed soup traditionally includes ingredients such as cream, seafood, cognac or wine, and a combination of spices. The origin of its name is still debated &ndash; some claim that the word refers to a soup that is cooked twice (<em>bis cuits</em>), since the traditional way of making the soup involves first roasting the shellfish and then simmering them again in the flavorful broth. Another theory suggests it is related to the Bay of Biscay, whose cuisine typically uses spicy ingredients similar to those used in bisque. Bisque was first mentioned as a shellfish soup in the 17th century, leading food historians to suggest that it was originally a fisherman&rsquo;s dish that was designed to get the most flavor out of whatever ingredients were available. Today, the most popular version of the dish is <em>lobster bisque</em>, which is made using a long cooking process designed to make the dish as flavorful as possible.</p>",39,16.401055,17.0936,7.253445,256.6302,0.028264191,Bisque,/Images/Dishes/3b9d84915b7b4dd5ba11bb44a2f1afda.png,bisque,48.85656725,2.34688282
Kar??,"<p>Japanese-style curry known as kar?? is one of the most popular dishes in the country. It started gaining popularity in Japan during the Meiji period (1868-1912), when the British introduced it to the country. During its early years, kar?? with rice was an expensive, gourmet dish reserved only for the wealthy. The main distinction between the Indian and Japanese curries is that the Indian version uses a combination of spices, while Japanese kar?? is made with curry powder. There are three main version of kar?? in Japan - <em>kar?? raisu</em> (curry over rice), <em>kar?? udon</em> (curry over noodles), and <em>kar?? -pan</em> (a pastry filled with curry). The most popular variety, is, as expected, kar?? raisu, which is usually served with <em>fukujinzuke</em> pickles or Japanese scallions on the side. Today, kar?? is so popular in Japan that it can be called a true national dish.</p>",39,0,0,0,0,0,Kar??,/Images/Dishes/9be8ad70c96f40e39a8578348aa9a61c.png,kare,35.68397151,139.7610326
Marinara,"<p>Marinara is a red sauce consisting of olive oil, garlic, tomatoes, and herbs. Onions might sometimes get added to the combination of these ingredients, and marinara might be transformed into another sauce such as <em>arrabbiata</em> or <em>puttanesca</em> with the addition of different ingredients. Due to its simplicity, marinara acts as a versatile base for many Italian dishes. It originated in Naples in southern Italy, its name derived from the Italian word for sailors (<em>marinai</em>). Some say it was named after the sailors because marinara's ingredients didn't spoil easily, and the sauce could be prepared quickly, in about the same time it took pasta to cook, so the two made a flavorful and cheap meal for sailors on their voyages. By the early 1900s, marinara became a classic in the United States of America as well, due to a large number of Italian immigrants. Today, it is commonly served hot with pasta such as ziti, linguini, or spaghetti.</p>",39,13.83097,2.94603,3.088685,93.5169,0.033028094,Marinara,/Images/Dishes/81f1048274ed452fa31bbfe4ea767ad3.png,marinara,40.8363824,14.2497712
Samgyeopsal,"<p>Samgyeopsal is a South Korean delicacy consisting only of pork belly, the most expensive cut of pork in the country. It is so popular in South Korea that the residents eat it approximately once every four days. The name of the dish consists of three words: <em>sam</em> (three), <em>gyeop</em> (layered), and <em>sal</em> (meat), so it can be literally translated as <em>three-layered meat</em>, referring to the three visible layers of the meat. It is believed that the dish became popular in the 1960s, when the price of <em>soju</em> decreased and people needed a dish to go with it, so they chose pork belly due to its low price at the time. Whether at home or in restaurants, samgyeopsal is traditionally cooked at the table in a special pan which is designed to let the fat run off the sides of it. The dish is most commonly accompanied by lettuce, raw garlic, green chili peppers, kimchi, and green onions. Two dipping sauces are traditionally served on the side: one is <em>ssamjang</em>, consisting of sesame oil, chili paste, and soybean paste, and the other is <em>gireumjang</em>, consisting of sesame oil, salt, and black pepper.</p>",39,11.5875,28.4868125,18.2861875,379.7166625,0.048157453,Samgyeopsal,/images/dishes/1042e4d004e5400d98647a7c203ae93e.png,samgyeopsal,37.56655373,126.9789004
Teppanyaki,"<p>Teppanyaki is a Japanese technique of grilling a variety of ingredients on an iron plate. Its name is derived from two words: <em>teppan</em> or an <em>iron plate</em>, and <em>yaki</em>, meaning <em>grilled</em> or <em>broiled</em>. Teppanyaki refers to a variety of dishes cooked in the aforementioned way. Steaks, seafood, chopped vegetables, rice, and dough-based foods such as <em>yakisoba</em> fried noodles are some of the most popular types of teppanyaki. In Western restaurants, the iron plate is often placed in front of the customers so they can watch the chefs work. In traditional Japanese restaurants, each table will usually have an iron plate so the food can stay warm as it continues to cook lightly. Although the history of teppanyaki is somewhat murky, some oral traditions trace it back to family dining in feudal Japan, when people would gather around the central fire and prepare simple grilled dishes. Others trace it back to the early 20th-century Kobe, where fishmongers used to grill the catch of the day in front of the customers. The first modern teppanyaki restaurant in Japan is called <em>Misono</em>, and it was opened in Kobe in 1945, while the first American teppanyaki restauarant was opened in Manhattan in 1964 by a young Japanese wrestler, and it quickly captivated New Yorkers before it spread to the rest of the country.</p>",39,21.13555556,13.45244444,21.52127778,314.7053889,0.068385476,Teppanyaki,/Images/Dishes/487a7ef853db4b7a89e77eb06eb923dd.png,teppanyaki,34.67998801,135.169982

BLT Sandwich,"<p>Crispy, crunchy and salty bacon, fresh, slightly acidic tomatoes, chilled lettuce, mayonnaise, and toast - there is little, if no excuses for error while making a BLT sandwich. However, there are strict rules regarding the ingredients, according to food critic Mimi Sheraton: the bacon has to be hot, freshly fried and extremely crispy, the tomatoes must be ripe and sliced thinly, the lettuce must have bite and flavor, so iceberg lettuce is forbidden, and the bread should be toasted until golden-brown. The origins of BLT are hard to pin down, but some claim it was developed from bacon sandwiches that were originally prepared for teatime in the English countryside since Victorian times. BLT sandwich first appeared in British cookbooks in the late 1920s, and its popularity boomed in America after World War II due to these important factors: lettuce and tomato became available in supermarkets and women, who were usually housewives, began to work outside their homes in much greater numbers than before the war. Today, the sandwich is so popular that it even has its own month, called the National BLT Month, celebrated in April.</p>",39,35.60557368,17.32198421,15.42388421,365.7441579,0.042171239,BLT Sandwich,/Images/Dishes/07eb03eeca58477e94fa975842418c5a.png,blt-sandwich,38.89525702,-77.03681602
Pizza Margherita,"<p>Pizza <em>Margherita</em> is a delicacy that is literally fit for a queen. In 1889, Queen Margherita of Savoy visited Naples, where she was served a pizza that was made to resemble the colors of the Italian flag: red tomatoes, white mozzarella cheese, and green basil. It was made by a chef named Raffaele Esposito of Pizzeria Brandi, who is credited for its invention. The Queen loved the dish, and Esposito named it after her - pizza Margherita, but such a pizza was also made before that time, and can be dated back to at least 1866, when the most popular pizza toppings included basil, cheese, and tomatoes, but the pizza was not yet named Margherita. Since those times, Margherita has become one of the most popular pizza varieties in the world, and in 2009, it was protected as one of the three <em>Pizze Napoletane</em> with an STG European label of protection, proving its excellence in flavor, ingredients, and traditional pizza-making techniques.</p>",39,46.73696,12.733955,14.428275,360.4396,0.040029661,Pizza Margherita,/images/dishes/b0f5c76fd9d64367ad0750ab2d3d1767.png,margherita,40.83565575,14.24792092

Teriyaki,"<p>Teriyaki is a Japanese cooking technique in which the ingredients are broiled, roasted, or grilled after they have been marinated in teriyaki sauce, consisting of soy sauce, mirin, and sugar. The word <em>teriyaki</em> is a combination of two words: <em>teri</em>, meaning <em>luster</em>, and <em>yaki</em>, meaning <em>to grill or broil</em>. Teriyaki dishes are characterized by their shiny and glistening visual appearance, achieved by the usage of teriyaki sauce. Food historians claim that teriyaki was first invented by Japanese chefs in the 17th century, along with a number of other dishes that incorporated grilled or roasted meat. Teriyaki dishes later became popular in the United States, during the 1960s, with the rising popularity of Japanese restaurants. Teriyaki chicken, pork, fish, or beef dishes still remain a popular choice throughout the United States.</p>",39,35.61222222,5.804444444,19.74444444,302.0555556,0.06536693,Teriyaki,/Images/Dishes/c49d6ee437b344c097da6551736ce0c4.png,teriyaki,35.68241858,139.7630445
Tsukemen,"<p>Tsukemen is a noodle dish from Japan that is eaten in a unique way. Cold noodles are dipped in the accompanying soup, broth, or sauce, which are served hot in a separate bowl. The noodles can also be dipped in vinegar or spiced up with chili sauce before consumption. Unlike <em>ramen</em>, where the boiled noodles are placed in the soup bowl, tsukemen is characterized by first washing the noodles with water, which stops them from expanding. It is said that tsukemen is ideal for summer because it provides the wonderful flavors of ramen without the extra heat. The dish was invented in 1955 by Yamagishi Kazuo, a chef at <em>Taishoken Ramen Restaurant</em>, who discovered it when he ate the noodles with the leftover broth and soy sauce. With a few tweaks, he placed the dish on the menu and called it <em>Tokusei Morisoba,</em> and ever since then, the dish gained popularity. Today, it is a standard menu item in most ramen restaurants with a wide variety of broth bases, such as tomato or miso.</p>",39,58.010975,13.250915,21.08788,439.9337,0.047934223,Tsukemen,/images/dishes/e58fde4d10d749bf94b56c57f1747ff9.png,tsukemen,35.68501701,139.751407
Frozen Yogurt,"<p>Frozen yogurt is a frozen dessert treat made with yogurt and (sometimes) other dairy products and flavorings. It is lower in fat than ice cream due to the use of milk instead of cream. Frozen yogurt is usually served with numerous toppings such as strawberries, bananas, or chunks of cookies and candy. The first frozen yogurt was produced in the 1970s in New England, but the name of its inventor is still a mystery. Originally, it was made as a low-fat option for people who consumed ice cream, but it wasn't a big success due to the fact that most Americans preferred the sweet ice cream over the tart frozen yogurt. In the 1980s, its popularity was on the rise, but still couldn't match the popularity of ice cream. Today, improvements in the recipes and the production process have resulted in a smoother, creamier frozen yogurt, making it a more popular choice than ice cream for numerous dessert consumers. Nowadays, the interest in low-fat foods seems unabated, and it can best be seen by the annual sales of frozen yogurt in the United States, reaching 195 million dollars.</p>",39,26.5365,1.5165,4.07625,137.93625,0.029551695,Frozen Yogurt,/Images/Dishes/467488fcdfbc4ea8a8e2dfa1c2a54885.png,frozen-yogurt,42.3024287,-73.25586011
Chili con Carne,"<p>Although some may think that chili con carne is an authentic Mexican dish, it is actually an original American dish, made only in a few places in Mexico in order to cater to the tourists. If the dish were Mexican, it would still be a staple on the Mexican menus throughout the country, since traditional dishes do not go away that easily in Mexico. Chili con carne is a meat-based stew consisting of finely chopped beef, hot chiles, seasonings, and water, although the ingredients that go in a chili are a subject of endless debates. Purists insist that there are no tomatoes or beans in a real chili, although many others beg to differ. The earliest evidence of chili con carne can be found in J.C.Clopper's document, who visited San Antonio in 1826 and wrote about this poor man's dish where chile peppers were stewed together with tiny pieces of meat. Today, chili con carne is a wildly popular dish throughout America, with variations such as <em>Tex-Mex, New Mexico</em>, and <em>Cincinnati chili</em>. There are also numerous chili cook-offs in the country, attracting thousands of participants each year.</p>",38,18.58543,11.045345,14.58669,256.13105,0.056950104,Chili con Carne,/images/dishes/36e3576445a4471c9faea0afb10e1b44.png,chili-con-carne,29.48673997,-98.50626779
S'more,"<p>A traditional campfire classic consisting of a roasted marshmallow and a layer of chocolate placed between two graham crackers - that's s'more, its name derived from a contraction of the phrase ""some more"", because everyone who tasted it was instantly hooked. The credit for the invention of this delicious nighttime snack goes to the Girl Scouts, who first published the recipe in their 1927 book called <em>Tramping and Trailing with the Girl Scouts</em>. That same recipe was credited to a woman named Loretta Scott Crew. The enduring popularity of s'mores is best explained by a few crucial facts - they're easy to make, induce a large dose of nostalgia, and are in the reach of any parent's budget. Today, there is even a National S'mores Day, celebrated every year on August 10.</p>",38,32.17857143,8.671428571,4.371428571,215.7857143,0.020258193,S'more,/Images/Dishes/98820f89bceb4a8fa56ef48864c1f5e9.png,smore,38.89484995,-77.03956157
Manj??,"<p>Manj?? is a steamed Japanese confectionery product shaped into various forms and incorporating different ingredients and flavors. Usually, there are two main parts of manju, the outer shell, created out of kneaded wheat or rice flour, and the creamy paste hidden inside the chewy outer layer. The most common variety is produced with wheat flour and filled with red bean paste, popularly called <em>anko</em> or <em>tsubuan</em>. The origins of manj?? probably lie in China but are nowadays traditionally associated with Japan. The origin story of this traditional treat says that the original Chinese creation had a meat filling, but was later altered by the Japanese vegetarian monks and stuffed with a semi-sweet red bean paste. Many varieties grew out of the original form, and the modern fillings include white bean paste and different creams flavored with citrus, fruit, chocolate or vanilla. The outer shell is most commonly made with wheat flour, but rice or any other starchy flour can be employed in its creation. Various colors are often added to the shell, creating an attractive and decorative dessert. Although it is typically considered a confectionery product, manj?? can also appear in savory forms and be eaten as a snack. These beautiful and decorative treats play an important part in Japanese culture. The red and white manj?? is often given as a thank-you-gift at weddings, and a special variety is often brought to funerals. It is also eaten as an everyday dessert and regarded as the favorite treat among the locals. Because of its alluring appearance, these petite sweets are often sold as traditional Japanese souvenirs.</p>",38,0,0,0,0,0,Manj??,/images/dishes/bf85ea90b4a64ccf86043748fa8335ea.png,manju,35.68223733,139.7636708
Nigiri,"<p>Nigiri or nigirizushi is a special kind of hand-pressed sushi where the meat is sliced and pressed on top of sushi rice. It was developed in Tokyo (then called Edo) during the 1800s. Sometimes, nori seaweed is used to wrap the whole concoction and keep it together. The topping is usually seafood such as shrimp, tuna, haddock, or eel, and it should always be fresh and of the highest quality. Traditionally, nigirizushi is paired with shiso leaves, wasabi, soy sauce, or pickled ginger. It is sometimes garnished with daikon and salted seaweed. The dish is traditionally eaten by hand, in a single bite.</p>",38,17.02244,3.25072,9.677505,136.10388,0.071103814,Nigiri,/images/dishes/84317b0d4d31436692c9b24e76fbbb32.png,nigiri,35.685017,139.751407
Panna cotta,"<p>Simplicity at its finest, this softly set pudding takes almost no effort to make, yet is nothing short of amazing! Even though panna cotta (lit. cooked cream) wasn't mentioned in Italian cookbooks until the 1960s, today it is considered a traditional Piedmontese dessert, and the original recipe calls for only whole cream, sugar, vanilla, and gelatin. When made to perfection and properly chilled, panna cotta is silky smooth, deliciously creamy, and has a gentle wobble to it. For a slightly lighter version of this scrumptious dessert, use half-and-half instead of heavy cream, or simply dilute heavy cream with milk. According to Anna Del Conte, a renowned food writer and leading figure in Italian cuisine, classic Piedmontese panna cotta is served on its own or sometimes accompanied with Brutti ma buoni hazelnut meringue biscotti, while the Valle d&rsquo;Aosta version of panna cotta is flavored with a dash of peach eau-de-vie and garnished with red berry coulis. In other parts of Italy, panna cotta is frequently flavored with rum or sweet Marsala wine and topped with a generous drizzle of caramel sauce, which perfectly complements the seductive aroma of vanilla. Imagination being the only limit, variations on this elegant dessert are virtually endless, and it can be easily tailored to anyone&rsquo;s taste.</p>",38,20.48334706,15.10878235,3.7316,238.2528235,0.015662354,Panna cotta,/Images/Dishes/08cc283d67f0439d94139f26d5637850.png,panna-cotta,45.06661901,7.682633153
Spring Rolls,"<p>Spring rolls are traditional Chinese snacks consisting of thin sheets of dough that are filled with various ingredients, then deep-fried in hot oil.

These flavorful snacks are commonly served as an appetizer, accompanied by numerous dips, tea, or coffee. Originally, spring rolls were called <em>spring dish</em>, symbolizing the beginning of Spring. Spring dish used to be sent to friends or relatives as a spring present and a blessing, and they were usually filled only with vegetables and fruits. The dish originated during the Eastern Jin dynasty era, and the spring dishes later evolved into <em>spring cakes</em>. With the development of cookery skills, the traditional spring cakes evolved into spring rolls, which were commonly present at Chinese imperial menus. Today, there are numerous variations of spring rolls around the world, most notably in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Vietnam, South Korea, Indonesia, and Australia, although spring rolls can be found in most Chinese restaurants.</p>",38,16.69713889,4.8735,6.397761111,157.8502222,0.04053058,Spring Rolls,/images/dishes/bd90f72483604358ba976bd035c86556.png,spring-rolls,39.9021244,116.3935824
Banchan,"<p>The term banchan encompasses a wide variety of Korean dishes that are traditionally served on small plates.

The list of banchan dishes is extensive, but the most common options include different kimchi varieties, pickled and fresh vegetables, stir-fry dishes, pancakes, or various combinations with noodles, as well as braised meat or seafood dishes. All the plates are usually placed in the middle of the table and are meant to be shared, while other additions to the traditional table setup include individual bowls of rice, grilled meat, and a communal stew (jjigae). Interestingly, banchan dishes are always served in odd numbers, since even number is considered bad luck.</p>",37,24.63818182,5.757272727,9.865454545,181.9754545,0.054213106,Banchan,/images/dishes/d0af9c0cb3b04975ba435a7b6c523f31.png,banchan,37.56646244,126.9783953

Moussaka,"<p>Moussaka is one of the best known Greek dishes &ndash; a baked casserole consisting of ground lamb meat and layers of sliced eggplant, covered with a thick layer of bechamel sauce that gets golden and crusty as it bakes. The lamb is sometimes replaced with beef, while the eggplants might be replaced with zucchini or potatoes. It is likely that moussaka has Middle-Eastern origins, and it was introduced when the Arabs brought the eggplant to Greece. Its Greek name <em>mousak&aacute;s</em> is derived from the Turkish <em>musakka</em>, which came from the Arabic word <em>musaqqa'ah</em>, meaning <em>chilled</em>. Moussaka is not an everyday dish&ndash;it is baked as a special treat for guests and family on festive days. An exotic version of lasagna, without the pasta, moussaka is exceptionally healthy due to the abundance of vegetables used in the dish. It is commonly cut into squares and served warm, not hot, as the dish needs some resting time in order to firm up.</p>",37,17.960675,16.31268,15.348695,273.5971,0.056099626,Moussaka,/Images/Dishes/e09ae12f45df40d193936d0861b1b95d.png,moussaka,37.98435446,23.72830341
Focaccia,"<p>This chewy, oily flatbread is quite versatile, and can be topped with a range of ingredients such as coarse sea salt, olive oil, herbs, tomatoes, or olives. Historians tend to believe it was invented either by the Etruscans or in ancient Greece, although unleavened flatbreads have long been made throughout the Middle East. The name focaccia is derived from the Roman panis focacius, meaning &ldquo;hearth bread&rdquo;, referring to the fact that focaccia was traditionally baked in coals in Roman times. The basic recipe spread to France and Spain over time, where the bread is known as fouaisse and hogaza, respectively. Foccacia&rsquo;s pockmarked appearance results from indentations made in the dough to prevent large bubbles from appearing on its surface during baking. Today, savory versions of focaccia are topped with rosemary, sage, garlic, cheese, and onions, while sweet varieties can be topped with honey, raisins, sugar, and lemon peel, among others.</p>",37,35.67137,9.912365,8.637445,264.8965,0.032606867,Focaccia,/images/dishes/dc63ccf296c048d9b05ed3de35270d56.png,focaccia,41.89307198,12.4834685
K??fte,"<p>Kofta or <em>k&ouml;fte</em> are walnut-sized fried meatballs, usually made from ground beef or lamb. It is a popular Turkish meze dish that is often prepared for special occasions and cocktail parties, since the meatballs are quite easy to prepare and can be easily consumed with a toothpick. K&ouml;fte come in various degrees of spiciness and in numerous forms - from egg-coated and fried <em>kadin budu</em> to <em>Adana kofte</em> from the south-east of Turkey. In eastern Turkey, the most popular variety is called <em>i&ccedil;li k&ouml;fte</em>, full of flavor due to large amounts of butter in the filling. Another interesting variety is called <em>cizbiz kofta</em>, one of the most popular street food items in the country, its name coming from the sound which the thin meat patties make when placed on the grill. Whether fried, stewed, drenched in sauce, or grilled, the variations are virtually infinite and every kofta dish pairs well with a glass of turnip juice and fried potatoes on the side.</p>",37,10.4,20.6945,18.7985,303.75,0.061888066,K??fte,/Images/Dishes/02634062753146088fd9ec0922790c50.png,kofte,39.92193413,32.85577475
Alfajor,"<p>Alfajor is a type of treat with <em>dulce de leche</em> or milk jam stuffing sandwiched between two sweet cookies. The combination is then coated with a layer of chocolate or sprinkled with confectioners' sugar. The name <em>alfajor</em> stems from the Arabic word <em>al-has&uacute;</em>, which means <em>stuffed</em> or <em>filled</em>. Although the cookies can be found throughout Latin America, they are originally from Andalusia, Spain, invented during the time when the country was occupied by the Moors. When the Spaniards came to America, they brought their foods and traditions along the way, and with time, almost every country in Latin America has adapted the Spanish alfajor to make it their own, so there are a lot of varieties of the basic, original cookie - including fillings such as chocolate mousse, fruit, and cream. In Spain, the cookies are most commonly sold and consumed during the Christmas season, but it should be noted that the traditional Spanish alfajor is quite different from the South American version, consisting of flour, honey, cinnamon, and almonds.</p>",37,22.32,6.3,2.17,172.645,0.012569145,Alfajor,/images/dishes/66ba623f6732487997ed9314a39cb8d4.png,alfajor,-34.60769349,-58.43790344

Kaiseki restaurants commonly offer a private room, which often comes with a beautiful view of Japanese gardens. The dishes are usually small and characterized by their presentation on a plate, making kaiseki similar to the Western <em>haute cuisine</em>. The word <em>kaiseki</em> means <em>hot stone in a kimono fold</em>, referring to a popular belief that Zen priests would place hot stones wrapped in towels close to their stomach in order to cure the hunger pains during their daily prayers. In the beginning, kaiseki was a vegetarian dish served during tea ceremonies, since it was believed that the tea would taste better if the guests were not hungry. Today, kaiseki is not only vegetarian, as it might include meat and fish dishes as well, with special emphasis placed on the freshness of the ingredients. With a huge variety of flavorful, artistically arranged dishes, it is no wonder that a kaiseki dinner may cost up to $500, excluding drinks.</p>",37,21.54315789,3.888684211,9.773684211,171.6894737,0.05692652,Kaiseki,/images/dishes/0736e2e73f56496c82e7411766b62427.png,kaiseki,35.68243718,139.7625223
Carpaccio,"<p>This traditional Italian dish of worldwide fame is typically served as an appetizer, and consists of very thin slices of raw fish or meat served on a plate with olive oil, cheese shavings, and lemon. Carpaccio was created in 1950 by a Venetian restaurateur named Giuseppe Cipriani, the owner of <em>Harry&rsquo;s Bar</em>, who first made the dish for Countess Amalia Nani Mocenigo, whose doctors had recommended she eat raw meat. Cipriani based the dish on a specialty from Piedmont consisting of slices of raw beef dressed with lemon juice, olive oil, and white truffle shavings. An impassioned art lover, Cipriani named the new dish carpaccio in honor of painter Vittore Carpaccio, whose style and bold colors were reminiscent of the intense red color of raw meat. Today, there are numerous modern varieties of carpaccio made with zucchini, scallops, beet, salmon, figs, and lamb, and it is said that any kind of carpaccio is best paired with a glass of wine on the side.</p>",36,3.330526316,12.65894737,24.83947368,163.1894737,0.152212475,Carpaccio,/Images/Dishes/b4176912a592417b9887b7d4aa879ff0.png,carpaccio,45.43865901,12.33499899

The chilled custard is typically set in wide, flat dishes, and is then topped with brown sugar which is either caramelized under a broiler or with a blowtorch. The origins of the dish are quite unclear, and England, Spain, and France all claim to have invented it. However, most food historians agree that custards were popular as far back as the Middle Ages, and recipes for custards circulated throughout Europe for centuries. The Spanish claim to have invented it in the 18th century under the name <em>crema Catalana</em>, while the English claim it was their invention from the 17th century, when it was known as <em>burnt cream</em>. At the end of the 19th century, the French term cr&egrave;me br&ucirc;l&eacute;e became popular, putting the dessert on the map from Paris to New York City. Regardless of its origins, this timeless classic remains a great example of simple, classical cooking &ndash; memorable, delicate, and flavorful, yet easy to make.</p>",36,18.63684211,13.77368421,5.059473684,228.9315789,0.022100375,Cr??me br??l??e,/Images/Dishes/73e86673e3f04bd7a61bd946d6914362.png,creme-brulee,48.85728277,2.350288091
Enchiladas,"<p>Enchiladas consist of a tortilla that is usually dipped in a chile-based sauce, then stuffed with various fillings such as cheese, meat, or fish. Then it is rolled up, baked, and topped with sauces, onions, beans, or more cheese. This highly versatile dish is believed to have originated from a Mayan dish called <em>papadzules</em>, consisting of corn tortillas dipped in pumpkin pur&eacute;e and filled with chopped boiled eggs. From there, numerous variations developed throughout Mexico and outside of its borders. The word <em>enchilada</em>, which first appeared in print in 1885, comes from the Spanish word <em>enchilar</em>, meaning <em>to season with chile pepper</em>. Today, there are countless versions of enchiladas. In northern Mexico's Sonora, they make them open-faced, topped with black olives and a red chile sauce, while the New Mexico version is prepared by layering the tortillas in a tall stack with cheese and onions between each layer. Enchiladas have become so popular that there is even a <em>National Enchilada Day </em>(in the US)<em>,</em> celebrated every year on May 5, also known as <em>Cinco de Mayo</em>.</p>",36,25.175,16.64555556,25.65888889,334.3777778,0.076736226,Enchiladas,/images/dishes/f00e62645fe04d46badde61bacdffe6c.png,enchiladas,19.43307383,-99.13278431
Foie gras,"<p>French for <em>fatty liver</em>, this decadent, expensive food product is made by using a controversial force-feeding process known as <em>gavage</em>, in which corn is fed to ducks and geese (primarily to the hybrid male <em>Mulard</em> ducks) through a feeding tube. The livers of birds which are force-fed in this way are enlarged and full of a buttery, slightly sweet fat. Foie gras is prepared by melting the livers in their own juices with a sprinkle of salt, resulting in a supple product. Usually served chilled and in scoops or slices, the texture is similar to that of ice cream. Foie gras is easily spreadable and full of rich flavor. It is creamy pink in color, and the only thing you need to enjoy its flavor to the fullest is a slice of bread or a crusty baguette, or if you&rsquo;d like to enjoy it in the popular French style, serve it atop a salad. Try it chilled on a piece of toast paired with a few fresh figs. Foie gras is primarily produced in the French regions of Alsace and P&eacute;rigord, and according to French law, only foie gras made from force-fed ducks or geese can be called foie gras. However, the production or import of foie gras has been banned in many countries, including India, Australia, and a number of EU countries.</p>",36,4.798655,32.74296,7.7796,376.003,0.02069026,Foie gras,/Images/Dishes/6915435887a9423da5630cfa92663787.png,foie-gras,48.85591844,2.351596916
Gy??don,"<p>Gy??don is one of the most popular and inexpensive fast food dishes in Japan. Its name can be literally translated to<em> beef bowl</em>. The dish consists of beef and onions served over a bowl of rice. Beef and onions are cooked in a combination of mirin, sugar, sake, and soy sauce, imparting a salty-sweet flavor to the dish. In the restaurants, known as <em>gy??don-ya</em>, there is often pickled red ginger and red chili at the table, so anyone can season their dish according to personal preferences. The restaurants are often frequented by numerous hungry students who eat on a budget, and some of those restaurants are open 24 hours a day. A beaten raw egg is sometimes stirred into the dish, while chopped green onions are a common garnish. Miso soup, salads, or kimchi are regular side dishes accompanying gy??don. It is said that the first version of gy??don stems from an old dish called <em>gy??nabe</em>, where thinly sliced beef is cooked with vegetables in a pot. The first popular version of gy??don appeared in 1862 in the Kant?? region, and it has remained an inexpensive, yet nourishing and flavorful dish until today.</p>",35,0,0,0,0,0,Gy??don,/Images/Dishes/3385baf186294a2db9034397283ba0ba.png,gyudon,35.68445159,139.7630051
Kasha,"<p>The fundamental dish of Russian cuisine is known as <em>kasha</em>, a porridge that has represented an essential Russian meal for centuries. Russian kasha refers to various dishes which are created with cereals, most commonly rice, wheat, or millet, and pseudocereals like buckwheat and quinoa. The dish is usually boiled in water and milk, and ranges from sweet to savory in flavor. It can be modified by numerous additions such as fresh or dried fruit, preserves, cheese, butter, vegetables, nuts, or honey. In the past, the porridge was traditionally prepared in cast iron pots and slowly baked in the oven during the night. This authentic Russian dish holds a strong symbolic meaning&ndash;it is the first solid meal served to children, and is typically served during funerals, thus symbolizing the circle of life. Varieties of the dish, prepared with different cereals, are often found in other Slavic countries such as Ukraine, Poland, and Belarus.</p>",35,45.08421053,3.012105263,7.806,237.3684211,0.032885588,Kasha,/Images/Dishes/1cdcc8750fe449a3b5dbfb631cb36bff.png,kasha,55.75027816,37.61828229
Zakuski,"<p>Before every traditional Russian main meal, there are <em>zakuski</em>, a course of appetizers that are usually served to guests who are seated around the table, although a buffet arrangement is also quite common. For special events, there might be a dozen or two dozen zakuski served to the guests. Typically, zakuski include appetizers such as cold cuts of meat, salads, pirozhki, cured fishes, pickled vegetables, a selection of cheeses, bread, and caviar. Zakuski is the most important course, and most hosts will spend much more time preparing and arranging zakuski than preparing the main course. The origins of zakuski are still shrouded in a veil of mystery, but it is speculated that the custom arose before the 19th century as a way of feeding guests who traveled long distances and whose arrival couldn't be predicted, so they were fed small bites of food while the main meal was being prepared. A bottle of vodka often takes the center spot on the table, since the zakuski table is meant to accompany and enhance the experience of drinking it, and shots of vodka are often repeated throughout the meal. Along with butter and bread, such as white, black, or a combination of rye and wheat, caviar is the most famous part of zakuski, often served in glass containers and consumed on its own, or on a piece of toasted white bread.</p>",35,30.76666667,6.333333333,6.433333333,212.6666667,0.030250784,Zakuski,/Images/Dishes/ab53888e7a034a63a1b52f50f2b74526.png,zakuski,55.74993083,37.61800674
Caesar Salad,"<p>The iconic Caesar salad was named after its creator Cesare (Caesar) Cardini, an Italian immigrant who lived in San Diego but, circumventing Prohibition laws in the United States, operated a popular restaurant in Tijuana, just south of the Mexican border. Back then, in the 1920s, during the Prohibition era, Tijuana was flourishing as many Californians, including Hollywood jet set, would often drive over to party and enjoy the good life. And just like it was the case with many other world-famous dishes, Caesar salad was invented through sheer ingenuity and improvisation. In 1924, on a busy 4th of July weekend, Cardini's restaurant was packed so when the renowned restaurateur realized he's running low on food supplies, as he didn't want to disappoint the customers, Caesar concocted a salad with what was left over in the kitchen. To animate the guests and add some flair to his new invention, Cardini prepared the salad tableside, as many restaurants still do today, tossing the crisp romaine lettuce with creamy coddled eggs, garlic-flavored croutons, parmesan cheese, olive oil, and Worcestershire sauce. Originally, the romaine leaves were coated with the dressing and placed on a serving plate in a circle, stem side out, so that the diners could enjoy their salad with fingers. In 1926, Alex Cardini, a former ace pilot in the Italian Air Force during WWI, joined his brother Caesar at his Tijuana restaurant. Back then, the dish was named <em>Aviator's salad</em> in honor of the pilots from San Diego's Rockwell Field Air Base who, reportedly, one morning &ndash; after a long night of drinking and missing curfew &ndash; woke up at Caesar's restaurant and enjoyed the salad prepared by Alex Cardini for breakfast. Later on, as the salad gained popularity with other Californian visitors, it was renamed to Caesar salad. Alex also added other ingredients to the already famed concoction, in particular anchovies, even though Caesar was said to be against that inclusion, claiming that the Worcestershire sauce was enough to provide the faint fishy flavor. Moreover, in 1948 Caesar Cardini established a patent on the salad dressing which is still today produced and marketed by Caesar Cardini Foods, Inc. as <em>Cardini's Original Caesar</em> dressing mix. Regardless of the two slightly different recipes and dressing variations, Caesar salad became a sensation sought after from coast to coast, eventually even becoming a success in Europe; especially after the Paris-based International Society of Epicures in 1953 proclaimed it as ""the greatest recipe to originate from the Americas in 50 years"".</p>",35,11.72372632,20.42196316,11.62322105,269.8164211,0.043078257,Caesar Salad,/Images/Dishes/333f3ce7ccc643e0bc91ebb0dbf28890.png,caesar-salad,32.50055089,-117.0797739
Chicken Nuggets,"<p>Chicken nuggets are chicken products made from meat slurry that is breaded or battered, then baked or deep-fried. Although the dish is highly caloric, it used to be considered a healthy alternative to the beef that was already offered. The nuggets were invented in the 1950s by a food science professor at Cornell University named Robert C. Baker. His prototype nugget mastered two challenges: keeping ground meat intact without putting a skin around it, and making batter stick to the meat in spite of the explosive heat of deep-frying. Baker invented the nuggets as a way to boost poultry sales, turning it into convenience food that appealed to lazy cooks. Today, chicken nuggets are one of the most popular items on the McDonald's menu, with their first noted appearance in 1980.</p>",35,13.557,9.8935,13.008,193.75,0.067138065,Chicken Nuggets,/images/dishes/18d7560c407e4d6288def76ed47d7e8d.png,chicken-nuggets,38.89553027,-77.03919057
Kayu,"<p>In Japan, kayu rice porridge is the equivalent of chicken soup in times of sickness, a common remedy for colds and fever. It is a simple dish consisting of easily digestible soft rice and water. The rice is often cooked in dashi stock or miso in order to enhance the flavors of the porridge. Due to its gentle and mild flavors, kayu is sometimes consumed for breakfast, and some hotel restaurants even serve it as a part of breakfast buffets. Since there is a much greater ratio of water to rice in the dish, it is often used as a weight-loss diet food.</p>",35,29.70599412,9.857464706,5.655311765,236.8315294,0.023879049,Kayu,/images/dishes/a2bcc572e98d4172a8d6a237364ecce8.png,kayu,35.68366575,139.7593623
Tandoori,"<p>The most popular Indian dishes are those cooked over a blazing fire in the so-called <em>tandoor</em>, a cylindrical open-top clay oven fueled by wood or charcoal. The tandoori technique evolved from an old Middle Eastern method of baking bread, which spread to other parts of the continent, including northwestern India, where people began experimenting with cooking meats and other foods in tandoors, adding special marinades and spice rubs, both of which are now integral parts of Indian-style tandoori cooking. The marinade used in most tandoori dishes starts with yogurt; it holds well to the meat, lends a note of mild acidity, and keeps the herbs and spices in place. Even though the clay ovens themselves impart a special flavor to the food, most of it comes from the traditional combination of spices. Tandoori dishes are typically either intensely red or yellow colored, depending on the marinade ingredients: the red is provided by ground annatto seeds, while the yellow comes from saffron or turmeric. In addition, tandoori dishes are also traditionally flavored with ginger, garlic, coriander, cayenne pepper, and a combination of roasted and ground cardamom, cumin, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and black pepper called <em>garam masala</em>. This spice mixture imparts a mellow but savory flavor to tandoori dishes, whereas the heat can be adjusted to one's liking by adding more or less cayenne pepper. Apart from flatbreads such as <em>naan</em>, <em>roti</em>, <em>paratha</em> and <em>kulcha</em>, some of the typical tandoor-cooked dishes include a roasted paste of cashews, corn and cottage cheese called <em>peshawari seekh</em>; roasted potatoes stuffed with cottage cheese, vegetables and cashew nuts called <em>balochi aloo</em>; and Indian classics like <em>paneer tikka, chicken tikka</em>, <em>tandoori chicken</em>, and <em>kalmi kebab</em>.</p>",34,22.85287778,5.694361111,13.47431111,198.5026111,0.067879768,Tandoori,/Images/Dishes/6aaed612e4244097bbd7ec85c343903d.png,tandoori,28.61200792,77.21765164
Omurice,"<p>Omurice is a short form of omelet and rice, the two essential ingredients of this Japanese fusion dish. The rice is usually pan-fried together with chicken and ketchup, then wrapped in a thin omelet sheet. Finally, the dish is generously covered with ketchup. Occasionally, scrambled eggs can be put on top of the rice, and ketchup can be substituted with demi-glace sauce. Omurice is one of many Japanese dishes influenced by Western cooking techniques and ingredients. Although it has become a traditional Japanese dish, it is usually prepared at home or served in non-traditional Japanese restaurants. There are two stories about the true origin and creation of this unusual fusion dish. One claims that it was created in Tokyo as a quickly-prepared dish to feed the restaurant staff. However, the other story tells that it was in fact invented in Osaka as a specially-designed meal for a particular customer who could only eat light food. Whichever theory is true; it is certain that the dish has been present in Japanese cuisine since the beginning of the 20th century. Nowadays, it is also commonly found in South Korea and Taiwan.</p>",34,51.07619444,13.32530556,14.11100556,429.6887778,0.032840061,Omurice,/images/dishes/a2120608e95c43d9b0debab127af82a2.png,omurice,35.68307926,139.7641031
Laksa,"<p>Characterized by its rich and spicy broth, this comforting noodle soup is one of the classic dishes found in many Southeast Asian countries. It was developed under the influence of different culinary traditions, which has led to the creation of numerous regional varieties that differ in flavors and ingredients. Two of the most famous versions are the sour, tamarind-based <em>asam laksa</em> and the creamy <em>curry laksa</em>. Especially favored in Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia, laksa is usually prepared and enjoyed at hawker centers as a hearty main course.</p>",34,37.63278824,11.07851176,14.11566471,317.4071647,0.04447179,Laksa,/images/dishes/46178ac85122425e891c724c7bf05d6a.png,laksa,3.158822466,101.7011899
Blini,"<p>These traditional Russian pancakes are prepared with flour, eggs, milk, yeast, and a pinch of salt. What distinguishes them from other pancakes is the addition of yeast, since similar equivalents mostly do not add any leavening agents. The batter is poured over a hot pan, shaped into a circle, and fried for a couple of minutes on both sides. The tradition of preparing this traditional Russian dish originates from ancient times: it was a ceremonial dish, served during the pagan holiday called Maslenitsa &ndash; a week-long festivity praising the end of winter and the celebration of spring. With their shape and color, blini symbolized the long-awaited Sun. However, blini are not consumed exclusively during Maslenitsa, as they have become one of the most popular dishes in Russia, and are also commonly eaten around the world. Blini are extremely versatile and can be served with sweet or savory fillings. Some of the Russian favorites include various jams, condensed milk, while the most famous savory version is topped with fish roe or caviar.</p>",34,14.12662,13.960105,6.115545,203.14315,0.030104608,Blini,/images/dishes/d1ebb714077d4dadabb21f3f598445a6.png,bliny,55.74772177,37.62590731
Kasutera,"<p>Kasutera is a traditional Japanese sponge cake made with sugar, flour, eggs, and starchy syrup. This Nagasaki specialty is raised solely by egg foam, with no added butter or oil, and has a soft, moist, and spongy texture. The cake is also known as <em>Castella</em>, and was brought to Japan in the 16th century by Portuguese merchants. Its name is derived from <em>pao de Castela</em>, meaning <em>bread from Castille</em>. Today, it is common to find Nagasaki kasutera in many variations, with flavors such as chocolate, green matcha tea, brown sugar, or honey. It is a popular gift and a nice souvenir to give to friends or relatives. Kasutera is so adapted to the Japanese cuisine that there is even a <em>baby kasutera</em>, a small-sized version of the cake that is traditionally prepared for numerous Japanese festivals.</p>",34,40.07,7.435,5.92,253.65,0.023339247,Kasutera,/Images/Dishes/8026704739634045b0b432a436c14a7a.png,kasutera,32.764988,129.885033
Thanksgiving Dinner,"<p>For most Americans, the Thanksgiving dinner usually includes seasonal dishes such as stuffed roasted turkey and side dishes such as mashed potatoes, a rich cranberry sauce, and pumpkin pie, among others. This celebratory meal dates back to November 1621, when the Pilgrims and the Native Wampanoag Indians got together at Plymouth for an autumn harvest celebration, now considered America's first Thanksgiving. The first feast contained turkey, venison, fish, clams, berries, lobster, pumpkin, waterfowl, and squash, and many of the foods remained a staple of modern Thanksgiving dinners. Turkey is so synonymous with the holiday that the day is sometimes colloquially called <em>Turkey Day</em>. Today, the dinner centers on cooking and sharing a plentiful meal with close family and friends, and it is so popular that there are annual Thanksgiving parades throughout the United States, the largest and most famous of them being <em>Macy's</em> parade in New York City, featuring marching bands, floats, and performers, and attracting about two to three million spectators to the streets.</p>",34,80.22235,29.648635,37.158455,951.527,0.039051393,Thanksgiving Dinner,/Images/Dishes/e7b9460ec2ce468ba5771a2538f0b748.png,thanksgiving-dinner,38.89518026,-77.03671812
Souvlaki,"<p>Souvlaki is one of the most popular Greek dishes, consisting of small cubes of skewered and grilled pork, chicken, lamb, or beef. It is a popular fast food item that is usually served in <em>souvladzidika</em>, small eateries that also often serve <em>gyros</em> and other similar grilled meat dishes. Souvlaki first appeared in ancient Greece, when it was called <em>kandaulos</em>, consisting of a combination of grilled meat, pita bread, cheese, and dill. The name of the dish is a diminutive of the Greek word <em>souvla</em>, meaning <em>spit</em>. The first souvlaki shop opened in Livadia in 1951, and today, souvlaki is sold in almost every Greek city, ordered as a takeaway, on the beaches, or on numerous street corners. It is usually served with a slice of bread, chips, pita bread, tomatoes, yogurt, or onions.</p>",34,22.91879412,11.95600588,27.98391176,325.5724118,0.085952958,Souvlaki,/Images/Dishes/d01a3bd1ebf14547a8bad28b031804e2.png,souvlaki,37.98332125,23.72691095
Chashu,"<p>Chashu is slowly braised pork belly, a staple Japanese dish infused with traditional flavors of soy sauce and sake. The dish can be made with flat pork belly, but the pieces can also be rolled to create more sophisticated versions which cook more evenly. Prepared pork belly is covered in a fragrant mixture of soy sauce, mirin, sake, and sugar. The liquid is additionally seasoned with sliced ginger and scallions, and the meat is braised on low heat for hours, until it soaks up all the layered flavors and turns the thick pork belly into an incredibly soft, tender, and juicy piece of meat. If the skin is left on the meat, it will caramelize during braising, becoming slightly gelatinous and affecting the final texture of the dish. The name and origin of this Japanese classic probably stems from <em>char siu</em>, the popular Chinese roasted pork dish. It was adapted with traditional Japanese ingredients to create a simple treat that is eaten throughout Japan. Sliced chashu is the essential component of legendary ramen dishes, but it can also be used as a stuffing inside bread and sandwiches or as a topping for other noodle and rice dishes.</p>",34,47.4201,16.83061,23.00184,433.0818,0.053111999,Chashu,/images/dishes/e3038f6979184e22adddbc485d34eb1a.png,chashu,35.68280269,139.7633595
Kalbi,"<p>Kalbi or <em>galbi</em> refers to a variety of grilled beef short ribs dishes popular in South Korea. The ribs are marinated in a sweet sauce consisting of soy sauce, sugar, rice wine, sesame oil, and garlic. Although the name of the dish translates to <em>ribs</em>, chicken or pork meat can also be used. The dish originates from 18th-century Korea, when killing cows was strictly forbidden. As workers were building the Hwa Castle, they needed to be well-fed, so King Jeongjo allowed the opening of only one slaughterhouse in the whole country to process beef and feed the hungry workers. Of course, it didn't stop at just one slaughterhouse, and that is the best reccomendation for trying the dish for yourself. Galbi is typically accompanied by kimchi, red bean paste or rice, but it can also be wrapped up in lettuce leaves with a variety of other vegetables. Due to kalbi's great balance of sweet and savory flavors and rising popularity, the dish even has its own annual festival since 1995, called the Suwon Galbi Festival, offering the visitors a chance to indulge in this celebrated delicacy.</p>",34,6.377777778,9.711111111,9.222222222,207.7222222,0.044396898,Kalbi,/Images/Dishes/30def00bbfdc4dc0a6a675b7b7261a21.png,kalbi,37.56644388,126.9815084
Butter Chicken,"<p>Probably the best known of all Indian dishes, butter chicken, also known as <em>murgh makhani</em>, is a staple dish at most Indian restaurants. The dish originated in Delhi during the 1950s, when a man named Kundan Lal Gujral opened his restaurant called <em>Moti Mahal</em>. The restaurant's cooks combined leftover marinade juices with tomatoes and butter, and then stewed the tandoor-cooked chicken in it, without even knowing that they have accidentally stumbled upon one of the most loved dishes ever and a future international delicacy. Moti Mahal became one of Delhi's attractions, and soon after, butter chicken spread throughout the world. With a combination of roasted meat, plenty of spices, a rich gravy made with cream, tomatoes, and butter, this dish is best accompanied by naan bread and garnished with even more butter, coriander, or green chilis.</p>",34,17.62287368,13.20335263,18.08424211,266.1124737,0.067957138,Butter Chicken,/images/dishes/2009ae3a54d145b79df508f2e4f5488f.png,butter-chicken,28.6715564,77.22979708
Karaage,"<p>Also known as <em>dry-frying</em>, karaage is a Japanese cooking technique in which various foods are first lightly coated in arrowroot starch, then deep-fried. The use of arrowroot starch preserves the natural water content of fried foods and produces a crispy outer surface, but alternatively, other coating ingredients such as wheat flour, tapioca, or potato starch can also be used. Karaage can be used for frying various meats and fish, but it is most often associated with chicken, and involves a special variant called <em>tatsutaage</em>, where pieces of chicken are first marinated in a mixture of sake, soy sauce, and sugar which are then lightly covered with arrowroot starch and deep-fried. This method makes the meat succulent on the inside and particularly crispy on the outside. If not specified otherwise, karaage usually refers to fried chicken, but apart from chicken, the technique is sometimes used with other ingredients such as <em>askarei</em> (flounder), <em>ika</em> (bits of squid), and <em>gobo</em> (burdock root). Japanese karaage dishes are usually seasoned with garlic and ginger, and served with soy sauce on the side. They are a staple of informal Japanese gastropubs called <em>izakayas</em>, casual places for after-work drinks and snacks, but they are also available freshly fried as take-out food in numerous supermarkets and convenience stores.</p>",34,16.66808947,14.29407895,16.91083684,273.6929474,0.061787624,Karaage,/Images/Dishes/ecd022d26c784731bab82a7731d8ecdd.png,karaage,35.68115965,139.7610173
P??o c??i,"<p>Served as an appetizer, palate freshener, or a side dish, p&agrave;o c&agrave;i is a Sichuan-style pickle made with various vegetables, mostly Chinese cabbage, carrots, mustard stems, long beans, daikon radish, turnips, cucumbers, ginger, and hot peppers. In Sichuanese cuisine, these crunchy, tangy pickles are always on hand, and almost every family keeps a large clay pot in their kitchen, filled with a variety of seasonal vegetables in a simple water and vinegar brine seasoned with salt, sugar, and Sichuan peppercorns. The sweet, sour, and spicy p&agrave;o c&agrave;i is most common in northern and western China, but is also easily found in restaurants across the country. It can be served with noodles or Chinese dumplings, but it is most often enjoyed with <em>congee</em>, a silky, savory, slow-cooked rice porridge which is as an everyday breakfast meal popular in China and many other Asian countries.</p>",34,27.5,2.04,4.6,154.48,0.029777317,P??o c??i,/Images/Dishes/5cb81ad37ab541739ce24d152e702560.png,paocai,30.67801069,104.0594238
Negima yakitori,"<p>Negima is a yakitori variety that is made with sliced chicken thighs or chicken breasts that are skewered together with pieces of green or Welsh onions (negi). Like other types of yakitori, negima is also typically seasoned with salt (shio), or a thick and subtly sweet soy sauce condiment known as <em>tare</em>. The ingredients are alternated on bamboo skewers and are then grilled over charcoal on traditional yakitori grills. Negima is one of the most common types of yakitori in Japan. It is commonly prepared and served in restaurants and <em>izakaya</em> bars.</p>",34,8.022794118,5.644470588,11.70338235,132.9515294,0.088027437,Negima yakitori,/images/dishes/7e6a6e699784414eaa132418f67ecc75.png,negima-yakitori,35.68278516,139.7599911
Makizushi ,"<p>Makizushi, meaning <em>rolled sushi</em>, is probably the most famous sushi variety. Invented in the 18th century, this type of sushi consists of <em>nori</em>, a sheet of dried seaweed, which is topped with a layer of vinegared rice. A variety of fish, teriyaki chicken, and fresh or cooked vegetables are lined in the middle of the rice, and the combination is then rolled with the help of a flexible bamboo mat. Finally, the sushi roll is sliced into six to eight pieces, creating a bite-sized delicacy with an intricate and decorative appearance. The whole makizushi group consists of numerous different sushi types such as <em>futomaki, hosomaki, chumaki, uramaki,</em> and <em>temaki</em>. They usually employ the same ingredients, but differ in size, composition, and shape. Hosomaki is the smallest in size, while uramaki uses the different order of elements, placing the nori inside the rice. Traditional accompaniments to sushi are pickled ginger - used to clear the palate before each bite, wasabi - Japanese horseradish, and shoyu - the traditional Japanese soy sauce. Even though it is rather easily prepared at home and commonly found pre-packed in numerous stores around the world, it is best enjoyed freshly prepared by a sushi master in traditional Japanese restaurants, followed by <em>sake </em>- the authentic Japanese rice wine.</p>",34,34.57692308,4.169230769,6.799230769,201.5676154,0.033731762,Makizushi ,/images/dishes/bef96c95c0344b86a5442e3185b350cd.png,makizushi,35.68222158,139.7623345
Mititei,"<p>Mititei is the closest thing to Romanian street food &ndash; a dish consisting of grilled ground meat rolls made from a combination of lamb, pork, beef, and seasonings such as thyme, anise, black pepper, and garlic. When translated to English, mititei means <em>the small ones</em>, referring to the small size of these skinless sausages. The most authentic way of preparing mititei is barbecuing the meat, so it is not a surprise that the dish is a staple of Romanian outdoor cuisine and roadside restaurants. A popular theory suggests that mititei were created when a well-known Bucharesti restaurant ran out of casings, and the chefs had to create a sausage to feed the hungry customers. Mititei are ideally accompanied by some french fries, a dollop of yellow mustard, and a cold beer on the side.</p>",33,3.937058824,17.50294118,15.68470588,228.1764706,0.068739366,Mititei,/images/dishes/93990f7d1c90425495884b111ad6a694.png,mititei,44.4359983,26.10436293
Sambal,"<p>This quintessential Southeast Asian condiment is usually made only with spicy chili peppers and salt. It is occasionally adapted with lime juice, onions, sugar, ginger, shrimp paste, or vinegar. Traditionally prepared in a mortar, it is characterized by its thick consistency and an incredibly strong and sharp flavor. This original Indonesian creation has gained worldwide acclaim, and store bought varieties are available at numerous Asian food markets and international stores around the world. Sambal is used in a variety of Asian dishes, usually as a spicy condiment, seasoning, or a topping served alongside meat, seafood, vegetables, or rice.</p>",33,17.81572778,6.140455556,4.384572222,144.5770111,0.030326898,Sambal,/Images/Dishes/9db48420f07a457a887a8d98a672bc07.png,sambal,-6.173492634,106.8257813
Falafel,"<p>Even though these protein-packed chickpea fritters are listed as one of Israel's national dishes, it is often suggested that falafel might have originated in Egypt, Lebanon, or Palestine. By the 1950s, to earn a living, Yemenite immigrants in Israel started making falafel in the streets, selling it wrapped in paper, which has eventually transformed this ancient dish into an early form of Israeli fast food. As an alternative to the Israeli version, fava beans can be used instead of chickpeas, while the mixture is typically flavored with parsley, coriander, cumin, and onions. Today, both in Israel and other Middle Eastern countries, falafel fritters are most commonly enjoyed in pita or lafa flatbread sandwiches, topped with fresh or pickled vegetables, and coated either in hummus paste, tahini dip, or a zesty, garlic-flavored yogurt sauce.</p>",33,29.08444444,11.12555556,9.262222222,267.3888889,0.034639518,Falafel,/images/dishes/abff042bc64d4e15b9443bbd531a5285.png,falafel,31.77974014,35.22338547
Ratatouille,"<p>This colorful Proven&ccedil;al vegetable ragout is traditionally made with simple, easily accessible ingredients: courgettes, eggplants, green and red peppers, tomatoes, onions, garlic, and parsley. The name <em>ratatouille</em> stems from the old Occitan word <em>ratatolha</em>, and the French word <em>touiller</em>, both meaning <em>to toss</em>, or <em>to stir up</em>, referring to the cooking process in which the ingredients are first simmered separately&mdash;seasoned with salt, pepper, and olive oil&mdash;and then tossed together and stirred into a vibrant vegetable medley. Though it wasn't until the 1930s that ratatouille was popularized, by the 1980s, the dish had become the star of any dinner party. Ratatouille can be enjoyed on its own, served either hot or cold, along with toasted garlic bread, or it can be dished out as a side to roasted or grilled meat mains, especially lamb and chicken.</p>",33,8.39686,5.48778,3.356135,96.82755,0.034660951,Ratatouille,/images/dishes/3ebacd33fffc4b49abb63bb1a9914805.png,ratatouille,43.29476724,5.376995772
Bocadillos,"<p>Bocadillos or <em>bocatas</em> are Spanish sandwiches made with Spanish-style baguettes known as <em>barra de pan</em>, unlike regular sandwiches which are made with modern white bread, known as <em>pan de molde</em> in Spain. The most common fillings for bocadillos include meat, cheese, tuna, omelets, jam&oacute;n, or chorizo sausages. The Spanish typically don't add onions, mayonnaise, pickles, or lettuce to bocadillos, but the bread is sometimes rubbed with halved tomatoes or olive oil. Due to the popularity of these sandwiches, the fillings vary from one region to another &ndash; omelet bocadillos are usually eaten for breakfast or as an afternoon snack and include eggs, cheese, beans, peppers, and potatoes; meat-based bocadillos are often made with chicken, beef, pork, horse, or goat; and fish bocadillos often include cuttlefish, sardines, and squid. These sandwiches can be found everywhere from bars and taverns to roadside eateries, but you probably won't find one on a restaurant menu.</p>",33,35.1,2.425,4.2025,181.4,0.023167034,Bocadillos,/images/dishes/ebf9c34fbfc640d987c95d0aeac66d7b.png,bocadillos,40.4162113,-3.703178609
Parrilla,"<p>Parrilla is an Argentine word with two meanings &ndash; it can be used to describe a typical Argentine steakhouse restaurant, or it can denote a metal grill used for preparing the meat. The metal grill is a part of traditional asado barbecues. It comes in many shapes and sizes, but it typically consists of a main grill with a firebox (called <em>brasero</em>) on the side. Firewood or charcoal are loaded into the firebox, and once the embers drop to the bottom, the coals are placed under the main grill. The plate is often tilted on a decline so that the excess juices can drip downward in order not to cause any flare-ups. Parrillas can be found in numerous homes and restaurants in Argentina, and the meat grilled on it typically includes chitterlings, morcilla blood sausages, chorizo sausages, salchichas parrilleras, ribs, sirloin, skirt steaks, and tenderloin.</p>",33,22.68157895,12.78947368,18.10157895,273.4,0.06620914,Parrilla,/images/dishes/4d14f2f2708b4a2abf7d5fe2da7619fa.png,parrilla,-34.60764964,-58.43621116
Kar?? raisu,"<p>Japanese curry is an extremely popular dish throughout Japan. Since the curry is almost always served with rice, one can hear the term <em>kar?? raisu</em> mentioned very often. Curry was brought over to Japan by the British in the 19th century, when Meiji-era Japan welcomed foreigners and their goods. As a result, Japanese curry is similar to the English curry, characterized by the heavy use of curry powder. The dish developed into curry rice, a rich stew of meat and vegetables (such as carrots, onions, and potatoes) which is ladled over short-grain, white rice. Common garnishes include eggplant, lotus root, and cucumbers on top. There is also a popular variation on kare raisu called <em>katsu kare</em>, a curry rice dish with a piece of deep-fried pork cutlet called <em>tonkatsu</em> placed on top.</p>",33,90.24166667,27.18,28.60166667,723.895,0.039510795,Kar?? raisu,/Images/Dishes/1a4c124ec7b949d09276d6e8d8339f48.png,kare-raisu,35.68342561,139.7620939
Crab Cake,"<p>Crab cake is a popular American type of fishcake consisting of shellfish meat, breadcrumbs, eggs, and flavorings such as mustard, Worcestershire sauce, and fresh herbs. The concept of minced fish meat combined with other ingredients dates back to the ancient times when ingredients were scarce. It is believed that a type of crab cake was first introduced to the early colonies by English settlers. There are numerous recipes for crab cakes from the 19th century, and many of them combined bread crumbs and spices, while some of them were fried. However, they were called <em>crab patties</em> or <em>crab croquettes</em> before the term <em>crab cake</em> appeared in the 20th century. Today, crab cakes are the most popular in New England, the Gulf Coast, the Pacific Northwest, and the Northern California coast. They are usually served on a hamburger bun, accompanied by saltine crackers, lemon wedges, french fries, cole slaw, or potatoes.</p>",33,11.00830526,17.9598,12.64431579,216.0067368,0.058536673,Crab Cake,/images/dishes/6b7d2dc336fa435694909cf621704406.png,crab-cake,38.89555001,-77.03771362
Ansim,"<p><em>Ansim</em> is the South Korean name for beef tenderloin, the most prestigious cut of meat. Believed to be the most tender cut of the animal, tenderloin is usually very low in fat, yet it remains soft and velvety. It is dark red in color, and the best cuts are usually marbled with thin stripes of fat. Since beef tenderloin is quite long, it is usually sliced into smaller pieces. In South Korea, ansim is typically roasted on a grill. <em>Gogigui</em> is the name of a traditional South Korean barbecue on which the meat is often grilled in front of the customers in a restaurant. Numerous beef cuts are employed in gogigui, but grilled tenderloin stakes are especially favored. The meat is occasionally marinated, usually in Korean soy sauce or sesame oil, but since it is juicy and tender on its own, it is often grilled as it is.</p>",32,26.815,2.195,5.725,150.5,0.038039867,Ansim,/images/dishes/e460b6a84abd4f40977b03dd6e23b7fc.png,ansim-south-korea,37.5652356,126.9788328
Minestrone,"<p>One of the very bases of traditional Italian cuisine, minestrone is a thick, chunky soup made with whichever vegetables are in season. Historically, being a poor man's food dating as far back as the year 30 CE, this peasant-style soup was made with a mashed bean or spelt base and leftovers from various <em>contorni </em>(side dishes) and other meals. Today, even though there's not a set recipe for this dish and every region has its own version, the most common ingredients include stock, onions, tomatoes, celery, carrots, and legumes. The vegetables are cut-up and simmered for quite a long time, but they must not turn mushy. Lastly, pasta or rice can be added to round-up this inexpensive, yet filling dish. Depending on the method of cooking, these flavorful soups are divided into two main categories: <em>minestrone a crudo</em> and <em>minestrone col soffritto</em>. While the first version uses raw vegetables and often garlic-flavored olive oil added towards the end of cooking, minestrone col soffritto is made with vegetables which are first saut&eacute;ed in butter, oil, pork fat or lard, together with pancetta (bacon) and pork rind. The perfect comfort food to warm a cold day, minestrone is even better when made in advance and served reheated, as it takes some time for the flavors to fuse and deepen.</p>",32,17.68421053,2.4,4.431578947,113.7894737,0.038945421,Minestrone,/Images/Dishes/b2bcc0ebcd9a41a2beb426bff0857a86.png,minestrone,41.89299239,12.48419318
Meringue,"<p>The sweet, airy, featherweight delicacy known as meringue is made with a handful of ingredients: egg whites, sugar, some kind of acid such as cream of tartar or vinegar, and the most important, although invisible component - air. Meringue is incredibly versatile and it is mostly prepared to turn desserts into works of art: it can be whipped into frostings for cakes, spooned on pies, incorporated into cakes to make them fluffy, or mixed with chocolate, fruits, and ground nuts for extra flavor. The origins of meringue are still somewhat shrouded in mystery, but the <em>Larousse Gastronomique</em> claims it was either invented by a Swiss pastry chef with Italian origins, named Gasparini, or by King Stanislas I Leszcynski's chef, because some believe that the word <em>meringue</em> comes from the Polish word <em>marzynka</em>. There are also other sources claiming that meringue is an English invention. Regardless of the origins, most food historians agree on the fact that meringue was shaped with a spoon until the early 19th century, and the famous French chef Antoine Car&ecirc;me first started using a pastry bag in order to form this decadent dessert into a more aesthetically pleasing shape. Meringue can be consumed in its soft or hard form, and is usually prepared using French, Italian, or Swiss methods, which all differ from one another. These three methods gave life to a wide variety of popular desserts, including the beloved <em>meringue cake</em>.</p>",32,27.96842105,1.805263158,1.689473684,137.8947368,0.012251908,Meringue,/images/dishes/99c42f62414441c9a90ed527cd380ff3.png,meringue,46.94815438,7.452008382
Korokke,"<p>Korokke is a variety of Japanese deep-fried dishes that are a version of the French dish called <em>croquette</em>. It consists of a combination of mashed potatoes and chopped meat, seafood, or vegetables. The combination of those ingredients is shaped in a patty and rolled in flour, eggs, and breadcrumbs, then deep-fried. It is said that the French croquette was introduced to Japan in 1887, but today it can be found in almost every supermarket and store in Japan, since it is inexpensive, yet very tasty and flavorful. With its huge popularity, there is also a number of korokke varieties including potato, meat, tuna, curry, cream, and okara korokke. If the dish is placed in a sandwich, between two slices of bread, it is then called <em>korokke pan</em> or <em>korokke sando</em>. Korokke is often served with a type of Worcestershire sauce at the table and it is eaten with chopsticks, but if it's bought from street vendors, it usually comes wrapped in paper and is eaten using your hands.</p>",32,26.30526316,9.426315789,5.121052632,210.6315789,0.024312844,Korokke,/Images/Dishes/91e2777a874242019793b18c098c51b3.png,korokke,35.68197193,139.7604006
Thai Curry,"<p>Thai curry is usually a soupy dish consisting of coconut milk or water, meat, and curry paste. Unlike the thicker Indian curries, Thai curries have a more soup-like consistency, and the cooks prefer to use fresh herbs and aromatic leaves instead of spice blends that are prevalent in Indian curries. In many Thai homes, curry is consumed on a daily basis, and the cooks can choose from two varieties of Thai curry: water-based or coconut milk-based curries. The most popular water-based curry is sour curry, or <em>gaeng sohm plah</em>, which is often prepared with fish or seafood, while the sour flavor comes from tamarind. Some of the spiciest Thai curries are water-based since there is no coconut milk in the dish to subdue the heat. Coconut-based curries are more popular in the West, such as <em>red, green, yellow,</em> or <em>panang</em> <em>curry</em>.</p>",32,24.21052632,19.74210526,12.74842105,311.7684211,0.040890675,Thai Curry,/Images/Dishes/3e6a780ac7424aa497a0fa5db2ca47cb.png,thai-curry,13.75016103,100.4973236

Cannoli,"<p>These decadent, crispy fried pastry tubes filled with luscious ricotta cheese cream are perhaps one of Sicily's best known desserts outside of Italy. Cannoli are believed to have originated around Palermo during the 9th century, while Sicily was under Arab rule. Legend has it that they were originally prepared by the women of the ancient city of Qal'at al-Nis??' (lit. castle of women), the modern-day Caltanissetta, which at the time served as the harem of a Saracen emir. Later on, the recipe later somehow found its way to the monasteries of Palermo where nuns would prepare this lavish dessert during the carnival season. Cannoli have come a long way since then, becoming incredibly popular not only throughout Italy, but also in North America, where they were introduced by Sicilian immigrants in the late 19th century. Furthermore, thanks to one of the most famous lines from the movie The Godfather &mdash; ""Leave the gun. Take the cannoli."" &mdash; by the end of the 1970s, this dessert had attained a truly iconic status. Although people in the United States are familiar with different variations of this classic recipe, cannoli in Sicily are still prepared in a more traditional way. The crispy pastry shells are typically flavored with cocoa, suet, and Marsala wine, while the delicate freshness of the sweetened ricotta is sometimes enriched with orange blossom water, candied orange peel, chocolate, zuccata candied pumpkin, or finely chopped pistachios. The name is derived from <em>canna</em>, a cane reed that&rsquo;s cut into sections and used as a mold for frying the pastry shells, although metal cylinders have mostly replaced canna nowadays. And last, but certainly not least, cannoli shells are always filled just before serving to prevent them from getting soggy, ensuring the perfect feel of crunchiness against the creamy filling.</p>",32,21.067115,8.64878,4.178945,183.3152,0.0227965,Cannoli,/Images/Dishes/32066d4762f448baa7b2ada352bfcec5.png,cannoli,38.10845926,13.34834619
Japchae,"<p>Japchae is a South Korean dish made by stir-frying glass noodles and vegetables. The dish is often served with beef and additionally flavored with sugar and soy sauce. The name of the dish is translated to <em>a mixture of vegetables</em>. The original japchae did not contain meat nor noodles, and it was invented by King Gwangaegun's servant, who prepared the meal for a royal celebration. The king loved the dish so much that the servant got promoted to an upper rank. Since many Korean foods feature five colors, japchae also meets that criterium: green for spinach, red for carrots, black for mushrooms, and yellow and white for a fried egg, typically used as a garnish in japchae. Nowadays, japchae can often be found at numerous Korean birthdays or wedding parties, sometimes in varieties such as <em>gochu japchae</em> with chili peppers and vegetables, or <em>haemul japchae</em> with seafood and vegetables.</p>",32,63.52771053,9.461189474,8.365542105,368.5783684,0.02269678,Japchae,/images/dishes/3cae8f852eaf49dd976db91fe4362311.png,japchae,37.56424113,126.9788458

Sriracha,"<p>It has been widely accepted that this flavorful sauce that combines red chili peppers, garlic, vinegar, salt, and sugar was first created by a local woman Thanom Chakkapa in Si Racha, Thailand. Originally known as <em>sriraja</em>, the sauce was first prepared with fermented<em> prik chee fah</em> chili peppers and it was typically served as a dipping sauce or a condiment with noodles, seafood, fried rice, spring rolls, or pho. Outside of Asia, the name is almost exclusively associated with the brand Huy Fong Foods, founded by a Vietnamese immigrant David Tan in Los Angeles. His version is based on jalape&ntilde;o chili peppers, and in the recent years, it has become a global sensation, earning its place in many restaurants across the United States and Europe.

Lasagne alla Bolognese,"<p>This rich and filling piatto unico (lit. single plate; one-dish meal) is traditionally made from layers of homemade, typically spinach-flavored fresh egg lasagna pasta that is topped with b&eacute;chamel sauce and a rich meat sauce called rag&ugrave; alla Bolognese. Lastly, lasagne alla Bolognese is generously sprinkled with the Emilian king of cheeses, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and baked until tender on the inside with a perfectly crisp, browned top. This oven-baked classic is a typical dish of the Emilia-Romagna region, and of the city of Bologna specifically. However, it has become so popular over time that it now enjoys a position as a worldwide symbol of Italian cuisine. Unfortunately, as is often the case with timeless dishes, changes to the original recipe or the substitution of lower-quality ingredients cause many renditions of lasagne alla Bolognese that fail to live up to the splendor of the original.</p>

Meatloaf,"<p>The ubiquitous meatloaf is a dish celebrated for its simplicity and versatility. It is made with a substantial amount of minced meat, most commonly pork and beef that is bound by eggs or dairy products. Typically, it is placed in a special mold or formed by hand in the popular shape of a log. After it has been baked, it is usually sliced and served with mashed potatoes or vegetables, all doused in the accompanying juicy sauce. Meatloaf is not a dish that is commonly found in high-end restaurants, nor does it belong to haute cuisine. It is rustic and ordinary, yet incredibly comforting and nutritious. The history of the meatloaf as we know it today is believed to have its origins in ancient Rome, where a gastronome named Apicius first mentioned the idea of minced meat patties. It is believed that the now traditional loaf-shaped form grew out of the necessity to hasten the process and save time. Later, to stretch the costly meat, additional ingredients such as breadcrumbs, oats, panko crumbs, and even vegetables were incorporated into the dish. Modern meatloaf is usually associated with the United States. The popular belief is that the American meatloaf was invented and became famous during the Great Depression Era in the 1930s, but the most probable version claims it was a brought over by numerous immigrants who flocked to the United States from Europe. The reinvention in the United States has coincided with the technical advancements, and the first time meatloaf was mentioned in print was in 1899, near the same time during the invention of mechanical meat grinders. Today, it is hard to find a country which does not have their variety of this classic. They might vary in the choice of meat, selection of spices, and favorite additional ingredients, but essentially all the various national meatloaf types are interpreted as comforting and economical family meals.</p>",32,11.68495556,14.33715556,24.24332222,251.1452222,0.096531091,Meatloaf,/Images/Dishes/dc4cff147c844b2fb1f2a6ae4bf332c7.png,meatloaf,38.89663356,-77.03439307
Gumbo,"<p>There is nothing better to represent a true taste of New Orleans than gumbo, a filling soup that is usually prepared in large, black, iron pots. A cultural and gastronomical symbol of Louisiana, it can be based on seafood and okra with tomatoes, or on turkey and chicken with added ham, sausage, and poached oysters. Perhaps rabbit or a wild duck will be the main stars, accentuated in flavor by tasso ham. Regardless of its base, gumbo is always intensely fragrant and aromatic with onions, garlic, bay leaf, and thyme, its thick and rich liquids ladled into bowls with an accompaniment of steamed white rice. Gumbo evolved from the French <em>pot-au-feu</em>, when the slaves from West Africa added okra as a thickener to the already roux-thickened French stew. If okra was not in season, <em>fil&eacute;</em> powder was added, made from dried and crushed sassafras leaves, giving the dish a new layer of viscosity and a unique flavor. Whatever its variety of ingredients may be, gumbo must always include rice, roux (a combination of fat and browned flour that changes the flavor and modifies the thickness), and another thickener, be it okra or fil&eacute; powder, but never both at the same time. Fil&eacute; is typically used in thicker gumbos with sausages and chicken, while okra is used in lighter gumbos with seafood. Finally, a note for all gumbos - the ones that taste the best are those which had been left for a day or two and were then reheated, giving the ingredients a chance to combine into a flavorful and complex dish.</p>",32,21.10661111,7.720527778,12.23971667,220.7864444,0.055436903,Gumbo,/images/dishes/0069b59c364e4f9b9ac2f7e9d3edac0d.png,gumbo,30.45023561,-91.15379146
Greek Salad,"<p>Greek salad, also known as <em>village salad</em> or <em>horiatiki</em> is the national dish of Greece, consisting of quartered tomatoes, sliced red onions, and chunky slices of cucumber. Depending on the region, there can also be olives, green peppers, capers, feta cheese, oregano, salt, pepper, or a typical dressing made from olive oil and lemon or vinegar. When feta cheese is present in the salad, it is usually just sliced, but in some cases it's mixed in with a fork until slightly crumbled. Its name suggests that it was a rural dish, when farmers would take some essential ingredients to the field and mix them together. Greek salad is a true summer dish, full of refreshing, raw vegetables and herbs. It is best to prepare it with ripe tomatoes that are in season, while the olives should be of the <em>Kalamata</em> variety. Served in a shallow bowl, it is present on numerous Greek tables, either at home or in the taverns.</p>",32,14.72331053,15.97134737,6.539726316,228.3384211,0.028640499,Greek Salad,/Images/Dishes/a1a6c3135bcd438f8effd646aadee1f4.png,greek-salad,37.98341103,23.72837767
Pesto Genovese,"<p>Pesto Genovese is a sauce with origins in the Italian city of Genoa. Traditionally, it consists of basil, garlic, pine nuts, olive oil, and cheeses such as Parmigiano Reggiano or Pecorino. Its name stems from the word <em>pestare</em>, meaning <em>to pound</em> or <em>crush</em>, referring to the original method of making the sauce with a mortar and pestle. It is said that pesto originated from the ancient Romans who ate a paste called <em>moretum</em>, made by crushing together ingredients such as cheese, herbs, and garlic. Pesto is usually used with pasta, traditionally with <em>trofie</em> or <em>trenette</em>, but can also sometimes be served with sliced tomatoes or boiled potatoes.</p>",31,3.26,41.7235,4.7805,411.22735,0.011624956,Pesto Genovese,/images/dishes/5e7d9c2929724aa5aa470c4a09b0ea92.png,pesto-genovese,44.41029481,8.929909694
Poutine,"<p>Even though its name stems from the French <em>boudin</em>&mdash;a word that usually refers to the pudding-like fillings of sausages&mdash;this soppy treat originating from the French Canadian province of Quebec consists of french fries drowned in a thick, brown gravy dotted with clumps of pale, soft, semi-creamy cheese curds. The potatoes are more coarsely cut than regular fries, and they are sometimes even fried twice so that the exterior remains crispy while the interior remains soft, whereas the cheese does not melt but just softens, adding that special squeakiness to the dish, and the gravy is made with either beef or chicken stock with the addition of vinegar. Since its rise to stardom from the 1950s onwards, poutine has spread all over Canada and became popular in many parts of the USA where it's considered the ultimate late-night snack. It is found anywhere from food trucks to fancy restaurants, and even at Canadian McDonald's. Poutine connoisseurs claim that the best versions are served at small roadside stands where the curds are fresh, rubbery, and melt easily. Interestingly, in 2007, poutine was placed at number 10 of an online survey about the greatest Canadian inventions, conducted by <em>CBC</em>.</p>",31,68.046925,40.324795,21.593925,746.37285,0.02893182,Poutine,/Images/Dishes/d77b248723cd4df78f526dcc21b35529.png,poutine,46.82530059,-71.23371162
Brioche,"<p>This baked specialty is a French type of <em>viennoiserie</em>, a cross between a pastry and a bread, with a high butter, milk, and egg content that makes it rich, soft, and flaky. It has been enjoyed for centuries both as a delicacy and as a status symbol. One popular theory claims that it was invented by Norman Vikings, who settled in France in the 9th century and brought the secrets of making butter with them. The word <em>brioche</em> first appeared in print in 1404, and the name is believed to be derived from <em>bris</em> and <em>hocher</em>, meaning <em>to knead</em> and <em>to stir</em>. It could also be a reference to the popular French cheese called <em>Brie</em>, which is believed to have been one of the ingredients in the original brioche. A famine in the 18th century made bread expensive, so brioche became a status symbol &ndash; the amount of butter in your brioche was proportional to your prosperity. Today, it is traditionally consumed with tea, but it also has various uses in cuisine, acting as a vessel for sweet or savory fillings.</p>",31,30.22243684,7.304947368,4.921210526,212.8263684,0.023123124,Brioche,/Images/Dishes/ffbb7ae334ac4934878cabfa69ab2c25.png,brioche,48.85627287,2.349114391
Cordon Bleu,"<p>Cordon bleu is a very popular international dish with Swiss origins. In its most basic form, it consists of a meat cutlet that is filled with a thin slice of ham and cheese (usually Gruy&egrave;re), breaded, and either deep-fried in hot oil, shallow fried in a pan, or baked in an oven. The dish is usually prepared with two meat scallops, one on top of the other with the ham and cheese sandwiched in between. The first mention of cordon bleu is found in a cookbook from 1949. Today, there are numerous varieties of the dish such as <em>veal cordon bleu</em>, <em>chicken cordon bleu</em>, and<em> cordon bleu</em> served with mushroom sauce. The dish can be served with a variety of side dishes such as french fries or a selection of vegetables and garnishes such as lemon wedges and parsley.</p>",31,10.847,10.523,21.344,262.15,0.081419035,Cordon Bleu,/images/dishes/dca1e1795d9444a5b2bb566b7d077aac.png,cordon-bleu,46.94802436,7.452433093
Agemono,"<p>In Japanese cuisine, the term <em>agemono</em> refers to any kind of deep-fried dishes, and includes the three basic frying techniques: <em>suage</em>, in which the foods are fried without a coating of flour or batter; <em>karaage</em>, a method where food is first coated in flour or arrowroot starch which preserves its natural water content and produces a crispy outer surface; and <em>koromo-age</em>, in which foods are coated in batter before frying, just like tempura dishes. While koromo-age is most appropriate for seasonal fish, seafood and vegetables; suage technique is mostly used for frying freshwater fish, eggplant, green peppers and other vegetables whose color, texture and shape can be utilized to good effect. Lastly, karaage is typically used for meat, most often chicken, and includes a variant called <em>tatsutaage</em>, where pieces of chicken are first marinated in a mixture of sake, soy sauce and sugar, lightly covered with arrowroot starch and then deep-fried. Also, there is the so-called <em>furai</em> or <em>kawari-age</em> (lit. different deep-frying), a relatively novel technique which came from the West - it refers to breaded and deep-fried foods. Agemono dishes are traditionally prepared in the so-called <em>agemono nabe</em>, a thick-bottomed pot made from either cast iron or heavy brass which ensures an even temperature of the oil during frying. Agemono nabe is usually used in combination with metal-ended <em>saibashi</em> chopsticks, a net ladle or scoop called <em>ami shakushi</em>, and <em>abura kiri</em>, a special tool used to drain the excess oil after frying.</p>

American Pancakes,"<p>American pancakes are made from a thick batter consisting of eggs, flour, milk, and baking powder. Additionally, fruit such as apples, strawberries, and blueberries can also be added to the batter, along with buttermilk or chocolate chips. When served, they are usually stacked on top of each other, then topped with a variety of ingredients such as butter, maple syrup, fruit jam, honey, whipped cream, or peanut butter. American pancakes are often served for breakfast in the United States of America and Canada, and are sometimes accompanied by fried eggs, bacon, or sausages. In America, there are a few varieties of pancakes, and the most popular ones are <em>johnnycakes</em> (made from fried cornmeal) and <em>silver dollar pancakes</em> (smaller than regular pancakes). Originally, pancakes were symbolic of the sun and played a key role in the early religious rituals of the Native Americans, who first made them from ground cornmeal that was then cooked on hot rocks.</p>",31,31.37,10.0375,5.4025,238.125,0.022687664,American Pancakes,/images/dishes/4cbfc1a2b16f47cc8d511040838b4301.png,american-pancakes,38.89504536,-77.03607371
Gaufre,"<p>Delicious and fragrant waffles are the most famous Belgian culinary trademark. Made with thick dough or thin batter, the cakes are baked in a specially designed waffle iron which creates an unusual checkered pattern on the top and bottom of each cake. In Belgium, there are two distinct varieties of this national dessert: the light Brussels waffle, and the denser Liege waffle. The key distinction is in the batter: while the Brussels waffle batter is thin and runny, the Liege variety is made with a thick, brioche-like dough which produces a cake with uneven edges and dense texture. However, this distinction is only recognized in Belgium, while everywhere else in the world, this popular dessert is known simply as <em>the Belgian waffle</em>. Even though waffles have been present in Belgian cuisine since the Middle Ages, and were initially made with a mixture of barley and oats, they were made famous at World&rsquo;s Fair, held in New York in 1964. Maurice Vermersch, the innovator of the modern waffle version, decided to offer the waffles to American citizens, which proved to be a big hit. Since then, waffles have become a common breakfast staple in traditional American diners. However, in Belgium, waffles are regarded as street food - they are almost always eaten by hand, on-the-go. They are usually served plain or dusted with powdered sugar, but modern versions may be topped with anything from whipped cream and chocolate to caramel or sliced fruits.</p>",31,35.8365,12.513,3.799,273.55,0.013887772,Gaufre,/images/dishes/1794c482bf9c457cb3bb7d3f0a5cbd40.png,gaufre,50.846475,4.355465414
Borscht,"<p>The iconic borscht is probably the most famous Ukrainian dish. This simple soup is made with meat or bone stock, saut&eacute;ed vegetables, and fermented beetroot juice. There are many versions - the broth can even be fish or vegetable-based, and the choice of vegetables varies from region to region. However, the essential ingredients &ndash; beetroot and fermented beetroot juice &ndash; are mandatory. They give the dish a unique red color and provide the sweet and sour flavors. The exact origin of the dish is difficult to trace &ndash; although it is predominately associated with Ukraine, the origin of borscht is still fiercely debated. Regardless of its origins, it is one of the favorite dishes across the entire former Soviet Union, especially in Poland and Russia, where it is also commonly regarded as the national dish, and in Poland, <em>barczsz</em> with dumplings is a traditional Christmas Eve starter. Due to migration, the tradition of preparing borscht has long ago surpassed the borders of Eastern Europe, so today it is commonly found in Ukrainian restaurants across the world. In Ukraine, the dish is often served with savory yeasted buns called <em>pampushki</em>.</p>",31,23.31428889,6.182077778,6.068677778,173.7006111,0.034937573,Borscht,/images/dishes/80d9a60df1e64bddb0298e72effd6963.png,borscht,50.44994965,30.52501487
Century Egg,"<p>Century egg is a Chinese delicacy made by preserving duck, quail, or chicken eggs in a saline solution that consists of salt, clay, and sometimes ash, quicklime, or rice hulls. The solution causes the yolk to develop a creamy texture, and it changes the egg whites into a dark-colored, jelly-like substance. The dish is thought to have originated during the Ming Dynasty period in Hunan, when a farmer found duck eggs in a pool of slaked lime and decided to eat them. Afterwards, he added salt to the eggs in order to improve the flavor. Today, century egg is often compared to a rich cheese, regarding its sharp scent and flavor, and it is commonly served as an appetizer or a side dish, typically accompanied by rice and pork porridge or pickled ginger root.</p>",30,12.9275,9.707,10.3705,139.514845,0.074332592,Century Egg,/Images/Dishes/2e98e29984a84963b4098c901047a425.png,century-egg,28.18518412,113.0011996
Grissini,"<p>Grissini are traditional Italian breadsticks with origins in Torino, Piemonte, a region in northwestern Italy. These snacks consist of crispy, thin, dry bread that can be additionally flavored with rosemary, sesame seeds, onions, or Parmesan cheese. Grissini can be traced back to the 17th century, as they were invented to cure the health-related problems of Duke Vittorio Amedeo II of Savoy. Since the duke had problems with digestion, the doctor ordered Antonio Brunero, a Torino baker, to make a meal which the duke could easily digest. Brunero made the dough for <em>ghersa</em>, a traditional Torino bread, and stretched it into long, thin strips. When the duke consumed the baked product, it was proclaimed a great success and became a popular snack throughout Italy. Today, grissini are served in a number of ways, and one can easily find them in most Italian restaurants, served to guests before the main meal, either on their own, or wrapped in prosciutto as an appetizer.</p>",30,51.54684211,8.313157895,10.33105263,278.5657895,0.037086581,Grissini,/images/dishes/0ed1f8745e7e43408e56421d715f96cc.png,grissini,45.07057444,7.670063143
Ch??teaubriand,"<p>Contrary to popular belief, the word Ch&acirc;teaubriand does not refer only to a cut of beef, but to a method used to grill or roast a thick cut of beef tenderloin. The steak was originally prepared by a chef named Montmireil in 1822 for a French author, diplomat, and statesman Francois Ren&eacute; Vicomte de Chateaubriand. When served in France, Ch&acirc;teaubriand will always be accompanied by a sauce &ndash; most often either a traditional red wine sauce or B&eacute;arnaise sauce. The steak is usually served with a side of roasted new potatoes or tiny <em>chateau</em> potatoes.</p>",30,0.666666667,8.85,19.8,166.8333333,0.118681319,Ch??teaubriand,/images/dishes/039c85e487e848c1b208cfc7b93f668a.png,chateaubriand,48.85624767,2.351198199
Sweet and Sour Sauce,"<p>Sweet and sour sauce is usually associated with the authentic Chinese combination of rice vinegar and sugar. The probable origin of this sweet and sour mixture is the Chinese province of Hunan, where it was originally used as a condiment or a sauce for fish, meat, and vegetables. Some theories claim that the Chinese province of Guangdong was the place where this traditional sauce first appeared, but it is also possible that both sauces were developed independently at the same time in different provinces. The primary form had a pale yellow color, it was usually uncooked and served on the side as a dipping sauce. In some eastern Chinese provinces fruits such as pears and pineapples were used to create different flavor combinations. Later, the addition of various sauces, primarily soy and Worcestershire sauce, and different ingredients such as brown sugar, molasses, and honey, enabled the creation of numerous flavor varieties. The western versions usually add ketchup, which contributes to the distinctive red color of the sauce. In China, sweet and sour sauce is mostly used for dipping and is usually incorporated in stir-fries. The sauce is highly versatile, and can act as an accompaniment to seafood, meat, and even vegetable dishes. In the United States and Europe, it has become one of the most popular condiments and sauces, which has surpassed its original purposes, and is now commonly served in fast food chains and restaurants. This flavorful sauce is easily prepared at home, but can also be found in every better-equipped supermarket in China, Europe, and North America.</p>",30,13.89427778,0.148722222,0.338027778,57.36111111,0.005892978,Sweet and Sour Sauce,/Images/Dishes/32eafd03c09f45c7aa6f8ff17b3452d2.png,sweet-and-sour-sauce,28.18518412,112.9806002
B??nh m??,"<p>B&aacute;nh m&igrave; (pronounced 'bun mee') is a popular Vietnamese variety of sandwiches that share the same core ingredient - a baguette. The baguette was brought over to Vietnam during the colonial period, and nowadays it is one of the few happy legacies from the time. The crusty bread, condiments, and meats are all a legacy of French and Chinese colonialism, while cilantro, chili, and pickles reflect the Vietnamese taste for fresh vegetables and bright flavors. In the beginning, most banh mi sandwiches consisted of bread, meat, and seasonings, with no added vegetables. Today, the possibilities are virtually limitless - the sandwiches are stuffed with cold cuts, French butter, fresh mayonnaise, liver p&acirc;t&eacute;, cucumbers, cilantro, pickles, oyster sauce, garlic...and the list goes on. The bread should be light, with a delicate crust and a tender, chewy, and soft interior with a slightly sweet flavor. The meat on the inside can be chicken, pork, beef, seafood, cold cuts, or p&acirc;t&eacute;s, sausages, and terrines, but it is extremely important not to overstuff the sandwich. Most of the fillings and condiments are things that foreigners are unfamiliar with, and that just may be the secret to its popularity. With their cult-like following and savory Vietnamese fillings, these sandwiches have crossed the borders of their native country long ago, and banh mi shops are still popping up all over the world.</p>",30,42.81578947,8.072631579,7.130526316,282.5263158,0.02523845,B??nh m??,/Images/Dishes/33229db2286444db86621a340682dc04.png,banh-mi,21.02836334,105.8575127
Baklava,"<p>The remarkable baklava is a luscious dessert created with layers of thin phyllo dough intertwined with chopped nuts, all doused in a sweet, viscous syrup. The popularity of baklava has long surpassed borders, regions, and ethnic groups to become a dessert whose origin and invention is claimed by numerous countries. It is probable that it has an Assyrian origin, dating back to the 8th century, from where it spread out throughout the region all the way to Greece. The Greeks altered the recipe and created the thin sheets, known today as phyllo dough, but modern-day baklava is believed to be an original Turkish creation. However, it is almost impossible to pinpoint baklava's exact place of origin, and the debate about its authenticity is still going on between Turkey and Greece. Traditionally, baklava is made with sheets of paper-thin pastry at the bottom, followed by chopped nuts which are then topped with additional pastry layers. The other traditional way suggests alternating layers of phyllo dough with layers of chopped nuts. The original and authentic baklava should always have a nut-based filling, most commonly walnuts, hazelnuts, or pistachios, but modern versions have introduced unusual fillings such as apricots, chocolate, and even ground cookies. The dessert is typically prepared in large trays, and it is then sliced into squares, triangles, or diamond shapes before being doused in a luscious syrup made with water and sugar or honey. Very often, the syrup is flavored with sliced lemon, rose water, cinnamon, or cardamom. It is supposed to cover the entire tray and keep the delicate pastry succulent, creating a sweet and juicy cover around it. Iranian or Persian baklava differentiates itself because it is drier and lighter than other regional varieties, and it is often flavored with rose water. Even though it was once regarded as a decadent treat that was mostly enjoyed by the aristocracy, the famous baklava is now a traditional pastry and a dessert offered in numerous Oriental, Turkish, or Greek restaurants. It is also often found in pastry shops across the Balkan region all the way to the Middle East.</p>",30,41.23222632,12.20577368,6.751736842,215.1115263,0.031387146,Baklava,/Images/Dishes/dbafb72807ae492790a3394608aebcda.png,baklava,39.92149386,32.85487052
Gratin,"<p>The French expression <em>au gratin</em> is an everyday term in the culinary world, denoting a technique for preparing oven-baked dishes. In the 16th century or even earlier, the word <em>gratin</em> referred to the burnt, crispy bits of a dish that were stuck to the bottom of a pot or pan, which had to be grated or scraped off if they were not to go to waste. Today, gratin commonly refers to any dish with a crispy baked topping. The ingredients for gratin most often include cream, grated cheese, and breadcrumbs, or a combination of the three. In addition to baking the dish uncovered in a hot oven, the au gratin effect can also be achieved by quickly browning of the top of a prepared dish under a broiler, giving it a nice crispy crust. The technique is thought to have originated in Provence, but nowadays it is popular throughout the world. In addition to the famed <em>potatoes &agrave; la Dauphinoise</em>, gratin is a technique widely used in the preparation of various other vegetable-based dishes, as well as numerous meat, fish, and pasta casseroles.</p>",30,20.58718,14.152005,11.772385,250.76745,0.046945427,Gratin,/Images/Dishes/6e53612a918c42b99a8c6b0d6f7199aa.png,gratin,48.85707127,2.351576701
Hot Pot,"<p>Hot pot is a traditional Chinese technique of preparing soup-like or stew-like dishes made with a variety of East Asian ingredients.

Kung Pao Chicken,"<p>A staple of westernized Chinese cuisine and one of the favorite dishes of foreigners in China, kung pao chicken is a spicy stir-fry dish made with diced chicken, vegetables, peanuts, and Sichuan peppercorns. It was invented in the Sichuan Province and has a unique, interesting origin story. In the 19th century, a boy named Ding Baozhen fell into a river and almost drowned. A passing stranger saved him, and as the years went by, Ding grew up to become a government official. He went to visit the man who saved him and ate a dish made with diced chicken, peanuts, and spicy peppercorns while visiting his home. Ding loved the dish so much that he asked the chef for a recipe, and then started serving it to his guests. The dish quickly spread in the Sichuan Province, and many years later, it is still popular both in China and in the rest of the world. Although it's commonly eaten in North America, the dish is cooked differently and lacks the unique spice that makes the original so flavorful, because it was illegal to import it to the United States until 2005. However, it remains one of the most popular dishes in most Chinese restaurants throughout the world.</p>",30,28.04974,13.93296,25.41252,347.258,0.073180517,Kung Pao Chicken,/images/dishes/1c22d89b1a224ae2b858bf13a3b85873.png,kung-pao-chicken,30.67509222,104.047647
Snickerdoodle,"<p>Snickerdoodles are classic old-fashioned cookies that are rolled in a mixture of cinnamon and white sugar, consisting of butter, sugar, eggs, and flour. They are characterized by their texture (soft or crispy), a cracked surface of the exterior, and a buttery, sweet flavor. The cookies got their name from the German word <em>Schneckennudeln</em>, meaning <em>cinnamon-dusted sweet rolls</em>, and another theory suggest that the name stems from a series of tales from the 1900s that centered around a hero named Snickerdoodle. Snickerdoodles are commonly baked for the holidays, eaten warm or at room temperature and are even better when accompanied with a glass of milk.</p>",29,25.40585882,7.613747059,6.459182353,188.6203353,0.034244358,Snickerdoodle,/Images/Dishes/e897fb73b41b4daaa4b606ebd6ce35e8.png,snickerdoodle,41.76541318,-72.69213191
D??ner kebab,"<p>D&ouml;ner kebab is a delicacy that is known throughout the world, consisting of grilled pieces of meat that are shredded from a vertical skewer. The meat is typically seasoned with fresh herbs and spices. Originally, the meat used in d&ouml;ner was exclusively lamb, but today in Istanbul, there are kebabs prepared with a combination of lamb and beef, or sometimes only with beef. Meat that is grilled vertically on a skewer isn't a new thing, as it has been mentioned in the 18th-century Ottoman travel books. The sandwich form <em>d&ouml;ner kebab</em>, which means <em>rotating kebab</em>, appeared in the early 1970s in Berlin. It is believed that Kadir Nurman was the first to place the shaved pieces of meat into a flatbread and serve it with vegetables such as tomatoes, lettuce, onions, cucumbers, and a squirt or two of sauce, unlike before, when the ingredients were served on a plate. Along with many of the Turkish variations on d&ouml;ner kebab, there are also numerous other regional variations in countries such as Armenia, Vietnam, Austria, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom.</p>",29,48.2735,19.16224,35.9885,501.55,0.071754561,D??ner kebab,/Images/Dishes/e7369b0dd4084406a558b39741d87009.png,doner-kebab,40.18206032,29.06741601
Youtiao,"<p>Youtiao is one of the most popular breakfast foods in China, consisting of Chinese breadsticks that are fried in pairs and connected in the middle. The result is a puffy snack that is crispy on the exterior and tender on the interior. Youtiao dates back to the Song Dynasty when the leader Qin Gui, under the influence of his wife, executed a general named Yue Fei, who was loved by the people. As a sign of protest, a cook made a pair of breadsticks that were shaped to resemble human beings (the leader and his wife), and symbolically deep-fried them in hot oil. That is how youtiao got its nickname - <em>you zha gui</em>, literally translated to <em>deep fried ghosts</em>.

Dango,"<p>Dango is a traditional Japanese sweet treat, presented as rice flour and sugar dumplings skewered on a bamboo stick. Some region-specific versions use other types of flour (such as potato or millet flour) or different ingredients such as green tea or azuki bean paste. Dango has been consumed in Japan since the Jomon period, when the forest nuts were pounded into flour that was then used to make the dish. Today, there are numerous varieties of dango, such as <em>anko, cha, kuri, niku, teppanyaki, denpun, bocchan, sasa, kinako</em>, and <em>hanami</em> dango. The most popular variety is called <em>mitarashi dango</em>, coated in a sweet, soy sauce-based syrup, and the dish is commonly accompanied by green tea, like the majority of dango sweets.</p>",29,32.25556316,2.130210526,3.004557895,163.6690526,0.01835752,Dango,/images/dishes/2266b392a1444c0f8a6dbf722bbd2e91.png,dango,35.67990135,139.7661208
Wiener Schnitzel,"<p>One of the best known dishes of Austrian cuisine, the Wiener schnitzel is a thinned, breaded, and pan-fried veal cutlet that is traditionally served with a dollop of lingonberry jam, lemon wedges, and either buttered parsley potatoes, a simple potato salad, or French fries. The dish is protected under Austrian law, and&mdash;if it is to be called <em>Wiener schnitzel</em>&mdash;it must be made with veal. Despite this dish being one of Austria&rsquo;s most popular offerings, it has been suggested that this Austrian national dish was actually invented elsewhere. According to one legend, in the 19th century, Austrian field marshal Josef Radetzky supposedly brought the schnitzel to Vienna upon returning home from Italy, where he had enjoyed the Milanese <em>cotoletta</em>, a dish that bears quite a strong resemblance to the Viennese classic. Regardless of its true origins, the crispy, yet tender Wiener schnitzel remains a favorite in Austria and beyond. The most popular spot for the schnitzel is restaurant <em>Figlm&uuml;ller</em>, where it's prepared with pork due to the fact that veal was not easy to come by back in the day when the original recipe was written.</p>",29,21.22844,9.928635,21.75678,263.4338,0.082589174,Wiener Schnitzel,/Images/Dishes/fb441da05fd64d00bbdbbe0deaf335b1.png,wiener-schnitzel,48.20021706,16.36698994
Tandoori Chicken,"<p>Tandoori chicken is one of the most popular dishes in Indian cuisine, its name derived from the Persian word <em>tannur</em>, meaning <em>fire</em>. The dish consists of chicken meat that is marinated in yogurt, seasoned with tandoori masala, nutmeg, and cumin, then placed on skewers. It is a unique dish because of the way it is prepared - traditionally, it is cooked at high temperatures in cylindrical clay ovens called <em>tandoor</em>, resulting in succulent meat with a smokey flavor. One popular theory suggests that it was invented by a man named Kundan Lal Gujral in his restaurant <em>Moti Mahal</em> (Palace of Pearls). He wanted to make a new dish, so he tried cooking the chicken in the tandoor, which was mostly used for baking the famous Indian bread called naan. The dish was an instant hit with the hungry customers, and the crispy, yet succulent chicken dish even caught the attention of Indian Prime Minister Jawaharial Nehru, who often ate at the restaurant and made it a regular dish at official banquets. The aforementioned theory belongs to the recent past, but historians claim that tandoor-cooked chicken actually dates back to the Mughal period, when the dish was merely a part of gigantic Indian feasts at the time. Tandoori chicken's fame led to many derivatives such as <em>chicken tikka masala</em> and <em>butter chicken</em>, both of them commonly found in restaurants across the country.</p>",29,13.482725,9.767405,25.08988,256.261,0.097907524,Tandoori Chicken,/images/dishes/9506a5e3b24c423cb422e5f75659ce65.png,tandoori-chicken,30.71869452,76.76424263
Tendon,"<p>A delicious combination of tempura and donburi - hence the name tendon - this classic Japanese one-bowl meal consists of battered and deep-fried seafood or vegetables laid over freshly steamed rice. The most popular ingredients for tendon include <em>ebi</em> or shrimps, which can be found in virtually all tempura dishes, and Japanese eggplant called <em>nasu</em>, but also other vegetables such as <em>daikon</em> radish and <em>kabocha</em> squash. Tendon is usually drizzled with the umami-imparting <em>tentsuyu</em>, a savory tempura sauce made with <em>dashi</em> soup stock and a mixture of soy sauce, mirin, and sugar called <em>kaeshi</em>. Alternatively, to make your tendon bowl look even more appetizing, the tempura pieces can be separately dipped in any dashi or soy-based sauce before being neatly arranged on top of a steamy bed of rice. In Japan, tendon dishes are most often enjoyed for lunch or as a light evening meal.</p>",29,35.15888889,8.79,20.54666667,311.32,0.065998544,Tendon,/images/dishes/8d7221b2a72d41edb73f7bebb59ea043.png,tendon,35.6817658,139.7637344
Spaghetti alle vongole,"<p>Quick and easy to prepare, yet packing some serious flavor, spaghetti alle vongole is a traditional Neapolitan dish consisting of only two key ingredients: vongole clams and pasta. However, there is a heated debate considering secondary ingredients, primarily the tomatoes. Purists adore the original dish, made without tomatoes, known as <em>bianco</em> version, while the others prefer a version with crushed tomatoes, or a version with a tomato sauce, known as <em>spaghetti alle vongole con la salsa di pomodoro</em>. Similar issues arise regarding the addition or omission of peperoncino and pepper in the dish. Regardless of these issues, everyone agrees that the pasta should be cooked <em>al dente</em>. Although the dish is best in the summer, when all of the ingredients are as fresh as they might be, it is also one of the most important meals of the traditional Neapolitan Christmas Eve dinner, known as Cena della vigilia di Natale<em>.</em></p>",29,41.78333333,7.985555556,12.52666667,304.7222222,0.041108478,Spaghetti alle vongole,/Images/Dishes/96daf8a67f98487d82e27107c80fcc75.png,spaghetti-alle-vongole,40.83638909,14.24937483
Oyakodon,"<p>Oyakodon is a poetically named dish meaning <em>father and child</em>, referring to the fact that both the chicken and the egg are used in the dish. It consists of a bowl of white rice that is topped with chicken, eggs, and chopped scallions. The eggs are poured over the rice before they have completely cooked, and the cooked rice finishes the job and helps the eggs to solidify. This simple dish is served in numerous Japanese eateries, such as <em>soba</em> restaurants. Oyakodon is especially popular at lunchtime, since it is easy and quick to prepare, which is a crucial fact for many Japanese businessmen. In addition to Japanese fast-food restaurants, oyakodon can also be bought from numerous street vendors. It is recommended to eat it as the Japanese do, from the bottom up, so that there is always some of the topping covering the white rice.</p>",29,60.41915789,10.51505263,23.30338947,453.0924211,0.051431868,Oyakodon,/images/dishes/945823a20aa94efab5e388515c7f3b50.png,oyakodon,35.685017,139.751407
Reuben,"<p>Reuben is a melty sandwich consisting of a combination of corned beef, rye bread, sauerkraut, Russian dressing, and Swiss cheese. According to one out of many theories, it was invented in 1914 at Manhattan's <em>Reuben Delicatessen</em> by its owner, Arnold Reuben, when an out-of-work actress ordered something new, and Arnold made her a Reuben sandwich. Since the combination of meat and cheese is not kosher, it is unusual to know that the sandwich was invented in a Jewish deli. However, it is part of the Jewish culture in North America and it can, of course, be enjoyed by those who are not Orthodox Jews. Just like most popular food, Reuben also has numerous variations such as <em>Rachel sandwich, grouper Reuben, West Coast Reuben, Montreal Reuben</em> and <em>Reuben egg rolls</em>. Savory, sloppy and extremely satisfying, Reuben remains a staple of New Yorker cuisine.</p>",29,40.20397895,38.25245789,34.95055263,649.4472684,0.053815844,Reuben,/Images/Dishes/8c169828c5ad43ceac7e04f0ceec42e9.png,reuben,40.75010886,-73.98001833
Feijoada (Brazil),"<p>Feijoada or <em>feijoada completa</em> is Brazil's national dish, a hearty stew featuring pork and black beans. The dish is consumed throughout the country, and every family in Brazil has their own, special recipe. Saut&eacute;ed greens, cheese rolls, rice, and fresh, sliced oranges are served as an accompaniment to the smoked pork and richly flavored black beans. Traditionally, it is prepared for Saturday lunch, so that the consumers may sleep it off. The beans are flavored with onions, tomatoes, coriander, and garlic, while pork meat can be additionally enriched with dried beef and smoked pork sausages. Before the main meal, consumers are offered <em>caldinho de feijao</em>, a bean broth served in shot glasses or small ceramic cups and garnished with pork rinds known as <em>torresmos</em>. The name <em>feijoada</em> is derived from the Portuguese word for beans, <em>feij&atilde;o</em>, and it probably originated in the 1600s in Recife, on sugar plantations built by the Portuguese colonists, although some believe that it was created in Rio de Janeiro. The Brazilian version usually uses black beans, while the Portuguese one typically uses white or kidney beans. Feijoada is artfully displayed on platters full of ingredients, so that the consumers may choose their favorites and enjoy them at a leisurely pace. The meats are sliced and placed on platters; the beans served in large serving bowls, and the accompaniments include Brazilian rice, kale, cassava with butter or hard-boiled eggs, sliced oranges, and hot pepper-lime sauce. During the meal, <em>cachaca</em>, a sugarcane brandy and Brazil's most popular liquor, is served as a traditional accompaniment to feijoada.</p>",29,16.880495,12.653635,19.390825,253.6468,0.076448136,Feijoada (Brazil),/Images/Dishes/d49243fa41b9446487ab8db041659d95.png,feijoada,-15.79503847,-47.88020728
Himono,"<p>The Japanese term <em>himono</em> encompasses various types of dried fish products. It is usually prepared with smaller fish varieties such as mackerel or sardines, which are typically butterflied, cleaned, occasionally marinated, and then sun-dried or refrigerated. The technique grew out as a preservation method that enabled longer shelf life. In the past, salt was mainly used as a preservative, but modern day varieties mostly use it as a seasoning. When dried, the fish can be stored or eaten immediately, when it is usually grilled and brushed with a flavorful soy-based sauce. Himono is typically served for breakfast and lunch or as a late night snack at popular izakaya eateries. It is usually paired with rice and soy sauce.</p>",29,0,0,0,0,0,Himono,/images/dishes/edbf7a9c14de4ae898110eaf11c66a15.png,himono,35.68238973,139.7604873
Pot Pie,"<p>Pot pie is a popular dish with a long and vivid history, dating back to the Roman Empire, when it was regularly served at banquets. The savory pies are always filled with meat such as chicken, beef, lamb, or turkey, along with vegetables such as peas, potatoes, and carrots. Pot pie is characterized by its top crust, which is traditionally made with flaky pastry. The ancient custom of pot pie was revived in 16th-century England, when cooks used to make meat pies with tiny, gooseberry-stuffed birds on the inside. The popularity of pot pies soon spread to other countries, so in the 19th century, Americans became obsessed with a pot pie that featured robins in it. Today, pot pie variations with chicken and other meats are an American tradition and comfort food of the first order that even has its own day, known as the <em>National Great American Pot Pie Day</em>, celebrated annually on September 23rd.</p>",29,45.005955,29.60575,17.529715,496.6485,0.035296019,Pot Pie,/images/dishes/125183c5f0044c098b59b99a80c353bc.png,pot-pie,38.89419022,-77.03705859
Parmigiana,"<p>Found throughout southern Italy, parmigiana di melanzane is a type of gratinated vegetable casserole traditionally made of fried or grilled slices of eggplant layered with basil-flavored tomato sauce and topped with one or more cheeses, such as mozzarella, pecorino Siciliano, scamorza, and caciocavallo Silano. Contrary to popular belief, parmigiana has nothing to do with parmigiano Reggiano cheese, even though it is used in many recipes as it makes for a crunchier crust. Nor, in fact, does it have any connection with the city of Parma whatsoever. In fact, the name of this scrumptious summer dish supposedly stems from parmisciana, the word for &ldquo;Persian&rdquo; in the Sicilian dialect, and it is often suggested that the word is rooted in the Arabic badhnajan or Turkish patl??can, both of which mean &ldquo;eggplant&rdquo;. Although the eggplant was introduced to Italy by the Arabs as early as the 8th century, the parmigiana we know today may have originated in Sicily at around the 16th century, when tomatoes were first brought to Italy from the New World by the Spaniards. Later, the eggplant casserole spread across the country, taking on a version of its own in each region. Regardless of its true origins and the many different takes on the classic recipe, parmigiana di melanzane remains Southern Italian comfort food at its best, and is one of the most popular Italian dishes today.</p>",29,21.94,15.57,17.25,298.47555,0.057793679,Parmigiana,/Images/Dishes/309a871ad8ff4b5d82cfbfd3a317690a.png,parmigiana,38.11235264,13.35963785
Jambalaya,"<p>The cheapest way to serve a crowd of people, jambalaya is one of Louisiana's favorite dishes originating from the Cajuns from the southern parts of the country, where food was often scarce. At the time, there were many slaves in the country, so the word <em>jambalaya</em> supposedly derives from the French <em>jambon</em>, or <em>ham</em>, and the African <em>aya</em>, meaning <em>rice</em>. Another theory suggests that it stems from the Provencal <em>jambalaia</em>, meaning a <em>mishmash</em>. Similar to paella, pilaf, or risotto, its key ingredients are rice, shrimp or crab meat, finely cut, spicy, smoked sausage and smoked ham, diced green peppers, garlic, celery, onions, tomatoes, and the obligatory spices - thyme and bay leaves. In some instances, chicken is added to the dish, but today there are also numerous variations from turkey shrimp to alligator meat additions. Rice is added in the end, to absorb the rich flavors from the stock until there is no liquid left. It is cooked in a big, heavy pot and is known to be a crowd-pleaser, so it is not a surprise that it is the most popular dish on the Gulf of Mexico oil rigs, where the employees share a similar food culture.</p>",29,40.25797,15.39814,18.416205,380.07035,0.048454727,Jambalaya,/images/dishes/d8104c9c7f614666b2123b24c446603f.png,jambalaya,30.45077624,-91.15653371
Nimono,"<p>One of the basic cooking techniques in Japanese cuisine known as nimono refers to simmered foods which are traditionally a part of every meal except breakfast. Nimono is also the principal way of preparing and serving vegetables as well as one of the most popular ways of preparing fish. Before simmering, base ingredients such as various vegetables, fish, seafood, or tofu are usually blanched or parboiled in water, and then cooked in <em>shiru</em> stock over a long period of time, until the liquid is almost fully absorbed or evaporated. The shiru stock used for nimono is most often <em>dashi</em>, which can be slightly sweetened and flavored with sake and soy sauce, mirin, vinegar, miso, or other condiments. Depending on the combination of seasoning and the type of stock, there are several varieties of nimono dishes. <em>Misoni</em> or <em>misodaki</em> are typically used for fish or sometimes vegetables; simmered in a mixture of miso and dashi, flavored with soy sauce and freshly chopped ginger. <em>Nitsuke</em> is mainly used for simmering fish in a mixture of sake, soy sauce, and mirin or sugar. <em>Shigureni</em> refers to dishes simmered in dashi which was heavily seasoned with soy sauce, while <em>karani</em> uses only sake and soy sauce for simmering. Some of the most famous nimono dishes include <em>nizakana</em> or <em>nitsuke </em>- fish poached in sweetened dashi, sometimes with the addition of miso; <em>kakuni</em> - chunks of pork belly stewed in soy, mirin, and sake with large pieces of daikon and whole boiled eggs; and <em>oden</em> - a classic Japanese winter dish consisting of boiled eggs, daikon radish, konjac root, and fishcakes stewed in a savory, soy-flavored dashi broth.</p>",29,17.8777625,4.43314375,6.71604375,149.6004375,0.044893209,Nimono,/Images/Dishes/0875cb4a67854930b7c7d53262e0ba51.png,nimono,35.68419499,139.763022
Chicken Parmigiana,"<p>Chicken parmigiana is a poultry dish consisting of breadcrumbs-coated chicken breasts that are topped with tomato sauce and cheese, then baked until the cheese melts and the chicken is properly cooked. Although it has an Italian-sounding name, chicken parmigiana is actually an American dish, derived from an Italian dish called <em>melanzana alla parmigiana</em>, or <em>eggplant parmesan</em>. No one knows who invented chicken parmigiana, but it is very popular in American cities with a large number of Italian immigrants such as New York and New Jersey. Regardless of the origin, the dish is usually served on top of rice or pasta, while some prefer it as a part of submarine sandwiches. Chicken parmigiana is also very popular in Australia, where it is a staple in numerous pubs, often served with salads and chips on the side.</p>",29,31.655,13.2,27.765,366,0.075860656,Chicken Parmigiana,/images/dishes/c902d34213024950bf274bb2af4bd211.png,chicken-parmigiana,38.89455812,-77.03986571
Pot Roast,"<p>Pot roast is an American dish usually based on a tougher cut of beef that is seared in a pan and simmered in stock or its own juices. In America, the dish is also known as <em>Yankee pot roast</em>, referring to the fact that it's most often prepared in New England. In a Yankee pot roast, vegetables such as carrots, onions, and potatoes are simmered together with the braised beef. The dish is basically an American variation of the French dish <em>boeuf &aacute; la mode</em>, brought over to New Hampshire and Maine by French immigrants. To bring more flavor to the dish, it is recommended to add some oregano, rosemary, or thyme to the meat and vegetables.</p>",29,6.278947368,12.86,24.33052632,251.3684211,0.096792295,Pot Roast,/Images/Dishes/52a1b6af841c4b5b88b53b9858991a6b.png,pot-roast,42.36322505,-71.05158897
Pecan Pie,"<p>One of the hallmarks of traditional American cuisine is the classic pecan pie. It consists of a thin pastry crust that is topped with a mixture of eggs, butter, flour, a sweetener such as brown sugar, syrup, or molasses, and a handful of halved or chopped pecans. When baked, pecan pie should have the consistency of a thick, silky custard with a pronounced caramel taste. When it initially appeared in written form at the end of the 19th century, it was mostly associated with the American South, but today it represents an authentic American dessert, traditionally prepared on Thanksgiving Day. </p>",28,57.02971,23.043175,4.377955,456.55955,0.009589012,Pecan Pie,/images/dishes/05f9b00652244a20a277dbb9215cecc4.png,pecan-pie,29.76018814,-95.36513697
Mapo doufu,"<p>Sichuan in origin, mapo doufu consists of tofu cubes settled in a spicy sauce containing minced meat, traditionally beef or pork, and fermented black beans known as <em>douchi</em>. The dish is said to have been invented in a small restaurant called <em>Chen Xingsheng</em> in Chengdu back in 1862, while the name of the dish comes from the lady cook who created it. Namely, the word <em>mapo</em> is an abbreviation which can be translated as <em>pockermarked grandma</em>, referring to the woman's appearance. The numbing spiciness and hotness of the dish come from Sichuan peppercorns, chili oil, and <em>doubanjiang</em>, a broad bean paste, whereas additional ingredients include wine rice, soy sauce, ginger, garlic, a garnish of chopped green onions, and optionally, starch, which is used as a thickener. Once cooked, mapo doufu will have a spicy top oil layer which serves to preserve the heat of the dish. Steamed white rice is the perfect accompaniment to this dish, but mapo doufu can also be eaten on its own.</p>",28,20.01829474,13.01786316,15.46914737,253.9994211,0.060902294,Mapo doufu,/images/dishes/b81a4e5ab58c45d08a4f1f839d8a158d.png,chen-mapo-doufu,30.67067364,104.062512
Nabemono ,"<p>Nabemono is the name encompassing numerous Japanese one-pot dishes, cooked with a variety of ingredients. In restaurants, they are usually prepared tableside and served to the guests. The name derives from the traditional pot in which the ingredients are cooked, called <em>nabe</em>, while <em>mono</em> means <em>things</em>, referring to an array of ingredients used in the dish. Nabemono is primarily a communal dish, in which the pot is placed in front of the guests and filled with dashi broth, sake, and soy sauce. A myriad of ingredients, meat, seafood, vegetables, and noodles, are placed on the table and subsequently placed in the pot. When cooked, guests fill their individual bowls with broth and other ingredients. When the first pot is finished, the other is filled, until all ingredients are used. Usually, a bowl of ponzu sauce is placed on the table for dipping. Nabemono also includes dishes such as <em>yudofu</em>, when only the soft and silky tofu is placed in the bowl, and <em>motsunabe</em>, in which animal offal is cooked in the fragrant broth. This classic Japanese technique is found in most traditional restaurants, where it is usually served during cold winter months.</p>",28,28.55,10.35,22.95,308.5,0.07439222,Nabemono ,/Images/Dishes/121ad3a7a1834bed8374b5a6a2699426.png,nabemono,35.68313233,139.7625829
Tajine,"<p>Tajine, also known as <em>tagine</em>, refers both to the rich Moroccan stews and the cooking vessel used to make them. When referring to the cooking vessel, it is a round and shallow, clay or ceramic casserole with a tall, pointy, conical lid. The same lid fits into the base, so the steam condenses on its interior and drops back into the stew without any waste of flavors and moisture. The pots are ideal for slow cooking over embers or on a stove, resulting in buttery, tender vegetables and meat that falls off the bone. Tajines can be glazed or unglazed - the unglazed ones are earthier and darken over time, while the glazed ones are recommended for people who cook infrequently. There are also <em>serving tajines</em>, which are usually decorated and lighter than the other tajines, but they're not resistant to heat. In the area of Rif Mountains, there's tagra, an unglazed tajine with little clay handles and without a lid. A Berber tajine is known as <em>chalhaoui</em>, and it has a rounded, dome-shaped lid instead of the conical one. Tajines show Moroccan cuisine's affinity for combining different textures and mixing flavors, such as a well-balanced blend of savory and sweet, for example, chicken with tomato and almonds, and veal cuts with stewed, sliced pears. Baby artichokes, spring peas, and various nuts such as almonds or pistachios are a common ingredient in tajines. These dishes are often accompanied by couscous, steamed rice, or fresh, hot bread, and the varieties are virtually limitless &ndash; from seafood tajines with mussels and tomato sauce, to lamb tajines with vegetables such as onions, carrots, potatoes, and olives, fruits such as apricots and raisins, and lots of spices such as red and black pepper, cumin, saffron, and turmeric, tajines are a national dish full of creativity and flavour.</p>",28,16.94654118,7.887464706,7.624029412,186.2515882,0.040934037,Tajine,/Images/Dishes/e9929be7468a43b19f0d15842ccb0a1d.png,tajine,34.01612447,-6.803633117
Rendang,"<p>Rendang is an Indonesian meat dish which originated among the Minangkabau people in West Sumatra. The dish is famous for its spiciness and a long cooking procedure. It is often compared to <em>Indian curry</em> because of its consistency and unique flavors. The theory about how rendang was invented claims that the generous use of spices and long cooking hours were employed to preserve the meat in hot and tropical climates, such as Indonesian, so unsurprisingly, the need to preserve meat for a longer period appeared among the Minangkabau people. They were mainly traders who underwent long journeys and needed food which could stay fresh for weeks. However, the dish has a more symbolic meaning to them, because the main four ingredients used in rendang represent the Minangkabau society: the meat symbolizes leaders, coconut is a symbol of intellectuals, chili represents religious leadership, and other spices signify the rest of society. Today, rendang has surpassed Indonesian borders and has a reputation as one of the most delicious dishes in the world.</p>",28,16.16538421,22.13692632,24.87003684,365.7230526,0.068002377,Rendang,/Images/Dishes/c4bb54a60bd64e759e1aeb52b6d0d75b.png,rendang,-0.924688892,100.360145

Usually served as an appetizer, tom yum is traditionally garnished with coriander leaves on top. Due to its popularity, different versions of the soup started to appear over the years, such as tom yum gai, with added chicken, and tom yum talay, with mixed seafood.

Onion Rings,"<p>Onion rings are a popular American side dish item that is usually served alongside burgers or other fast food varieties, and they are usually accompanied by ketchup, mayonnaise, or some other dipping sauce. These crispy rings are commonly found in the United States, Canada, Ireland, Asia, Australia, and the United Kingdom. This popular side dish is made by dipping onion rings in batter, then deep-frying them until golden and crispy. It is still unknown who made the first onion ring, but the earliest recipe for this caloric side dish is found in John Molland's 1802 cookbook titled <em>The Art of Cookery Made Easy and Refined</em>, where the recipe suggested that the rings should be fried with parmesan cheese. Today, numerous restaurants claim that they invented the onion rings, one of them being <em>Pig Stand</em> from Oak Cliff, Texas. Regardless of the inventor, there is a large variety of onion rings today, such as <em>beer batter onion rings</em>, <em>blooming onion rings</em> (using whole onions), and <em>kanda bhajiya</em>, a fritter with gram flour batter. Onion rings are so popular that there is even a <em>National Onion Ring Day</em>, celebrated every year on June 22.</p>",28,29.52894737,13.75421053,4.004736842,259.8789474,0.015410009,Onion Rings,/Images/Dishes/2218ac820f78418d954e3f5a34f423d9.png,onion-rings,38.89407856,-77.03393492
Hollandaise sauce,"<p>This butter and egg emulsion is one of the five mother sauces of French cuisine, and one of the most famous sauces in western cuisine. It consists of an emulsion of egg yolks and melted or clarified butter with salt, pepper, and an acidic note added by either a splash of lemon juice or a combination of water and wine vinegar. Although the inventor of the sauce remains unknown, some claim that hollandaise was originally invented in the Netherlands before being brought to France by the Huguenots. Other food historians claim that it was originally called Isigny, a sauce that was especially popular in Normandy, but that the name changed during World War I due to the fact that butter was scarce and had to be imported into France from the Netherlands. The earliest mention of the sauce is found in a 1593 Dutch cookbook, and Pierre La Varenne described a similar sauce in his 1651 cookbook Le Cuisinier fran&ccedil;ois. Hollandaise sauce is most commonly used to season fish and steamed vegetables such as asparagus. It is also a key ingredient of eggs Benedict, and as a mother sauce, it is also used as the foundation for a variety of other sauces, such as B&eacute;arnaise and sauce au vin blanc.</p>",28,3.129126316,13.57575789,1.402642105,139.7566316,0.010036319,Hollandaise sauce,/images/dishes/d89e5c788387434381dc99875c4d3aca.png,hollandaise-sauce,48.85764616,2.35015204
Varenye,"<p>Varenye is a traditional Russian dessert consisting of various fruits and berries cooked together with sugar. The ingredients should not lose their shape, dissolve, or overcook in order for varenye to be properly prepared. Originally, varenye was cooked with honey before 1801 because Russia didn't produce its own sugar, and imported sugar was too expensive. Today, varenye is traditionally served at Russian tea parties, and the most popular varieties are prepared with strawberries, apricots, blueberries, and cherries. There are also some exotic varieties made with dandelion, tangerine, and rose petals. It can be consumed on its own, used as a topping for pancakes, or as a filling for various cookies and pies. Varenye is so popular that it was even one of the favorite desserts of some Russian tsars, Catherine II, and Ivan the Terrible.</p>",28,63.66666667,0.033333333,0.1,251,0.000398406,Varenye,/images/dishes/3e3569a428e746f1b8fb52e44642fed7.png,varenye,55.75135704,37.62036765
Calzone Pizza,"<p>This unique type of pizza is characterized by its half-round shape, made by folding a full-sized pizza in half. Hailing from 18th century Naples, calzone literally means pant leg, referring to the fact that calzone's original purpose was to be a pizza which can be consumed while walking or standing. Typically, calzones are filled with meats such as salami or ham and cheeses such as mozzarella, ricotta, parmesan, and pecorino whereas fried calzones with mozzarella and tomatoes are a specialty from the Italian region of Apulia, and are known as <em>panzerotti</em>. In the United States and the rest of the world, calzones gained in popularity after being the central theme of an episode of the hit TV show <em>Seinfeld</em> in 1996.</p>",28,78.16,31.42529412,34.55235294,749.7058824,0.046087878,Calzone Pizza,/images/dishes/0efe5d5d1587428b9d8a35a5e6b2dc4a.png,calzone,40.84094254,14.24478222
Corn on the Cob,"<p>Corn on the cob is an American snack made by steaming, roasting, grilling, or boiling sweet corn. Ideally, it should be freshly picked, while its kernels are tender. The corn can be grilled in its husk or without it. Once done, the corn is placed on a stick, a cob shank, or a skewer, which is used so that the hands don't touch the piping hot kernels. The snack is quite often seasoned with salt or smeared with butter. Although it is not known who was the first to place corn on the cob, it is known that the ancient Mayans ate corn off the cob after it has been boiled or roasted.</p>",28,21.20947,1.80175,3.515115,104.494,0.033639396,Corn on the Cob,/images/dishes/f9029d87c1984ce3a1ab1b3461331425.png,corn-on-the-cob,41.59168049,-93.60922306
Migas,"<p>Migas is a traditional, ancient dish in Spanish and Portuguese cuisine. At its base, it is made from softened bread cooked in fat. Its name, <em>migas</em>, is literally translated to <em>crumbs</em>, referring to its key ingredient - breadcrumbs. In Spain, the ingredients vary from region to region. Generally, the dish consists of water-soaked bread, garlic, paprika, and olive oil. Regional varieties include ingredients such as spinach, chorizo, and bacon. It is usually served as an appetizer before the main meal. In Portugal, migas is made with wheat or corn bread crumbs, garlic, and olive oil. Regional varieties of the dish include ingredients such as asparagus, tomatoes, coriander, kale, beans, or rice, and it is served as a side dish to numerous meat-based main dishes. Although migas is a highly caloric meal, it is often praised as great winter food that is extremely flavorful and easy to prepare.</p>",28,31.67733158,23.65451053,17.83104211,437.4149474,0.040764593,Migas,/Images/Dishes/719baf4281314257b576bb08bc685cc9.png,migas,40.41623889,-3.694986779
Milanesa,"<p>Often referred to as Argentina's unofficial national dish, milanesa is a humble, yet delicious meal consisting of a breaded slice of prime beef that is fried in hot oil, curling up as it cooks, due to the fact that the chosen cuts of meat have less fat and sinew than other cuts. The dish shares many similarities with the Austrian <em>Wiener schnitzel</em> and the American <em>chicken fried steak</em>. However, milanesa has its roots in Italy, and the original dish has been traced to the city of Milan and the famous <em>cotoletta alla milanese</em>. Some claim that the best milanesa in Buenos Aires will always be prepared at home, cooked by someone's mother, although many restaurants also have it on their menus. For the pure, basic experience, it is enough to squeeze some lemon juice over it, but it is often served with a side of creamy mashed potatoes or french fries, while one of the most popular varieties is called <em>a caballo</em> (on horseback), where a fried egg is placed on top of the meat.</p>",28,7.5295,6.8185,19.9285,176.9,0.112654042,Milanesa,/images/dishes/b7c718631e9043cda9e38f176fc45641.png,milanesa,-34.6065219,-58.43621254
Pico de gallo,"<p>Unlike most other types of salsa, pico de gallo is of solid consistency, made with a combination of coriander, onions, tomatoes, and hot peppers such as serranos or jalape&ntilde;os. Pico de gallo is very popular due to its bold flavors and the fact that the preparation process is quite simple: the ingredients should only be chopped, seasoned, and mixed together, and the salsa is ready to be served. Its name is means <em>rooster's beak</em>, but the origins of the name remain a mystery. However, there are some interesting theories about the origin of its name. Some believe that the dish got its name because the salsa was consumed using the thumb and index finger, an action reminiscent of the rooster's beak sting. Others claim that the name is derived from the color of the salsa, which is reminiscent of rooster's feathers. The third theory says it's because the ingredients are chopped to the same size as the food of a rooster. Whatever the origin of its name might be, pico de gallo brings freshness and flavor to numerous meat, fish, and egg dishes, or traditional Mexican dishes such as <em>tacos</em>, <em>nachos</em>, and <em>quesadillas</em>.</p>",28,3.34124375,0.31533125,0.5366875,17.25116875,0.031110211,Pico de gallo,/images/dishes/0fa47b62b6094289b30987a0056c80fc.png,pico-de-gallo,19.43229652,-99.13305607
Cremeschnitte,"<p>Cremeschnitte is a <span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">vanilla-flavored custard cream cake and an absolute classic among central and eastern European desserts. </span><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">It is known by many names, most of which have stemmed from the German </span><em>cremeschnitte</em><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">, and literally translate to either </span><em>cream slice</em><span data-preserver-spaces=""true""> or, in some cases, </span><em>cream pie</em><span data-preserver-spaces=""true"">. </span>According to <em>Historical Sociolinguistics</em>, it is believed that the origins of the cremeschnitte date back to the blend of two cuisines in the Austro-Hungarian empire. However, its Polish name <em>Napoleonka</em> indicates that this dessert might have possibly originated from the French <em>mille-feuille</em>, which is also known as <em>the Napoleon</em> - another pastry whose exact origin is unknown, even though its modern form was said to be influenced by improvements of Marie-Antoine Car&ecirc;me, the famous French chef-extraordinaire. Still, while the Napoleon is made up of three layers of puff pastry alternating with two layers of pastry cream, the typical cremeschnitte is made with only two layers of puff pastry held together by a hefty amount of vanilla-flavored pastry cream, which is sometimes topped with a thin layer of whipped cream. Cremeschnitte is most often simply sprinkled with icing sugar, but it can also be topped with a glossy and smooth <em>glac&eacute;</em> icing, and nicely decorated with a traditional <em>chevron</em> design. Two of the most popular cremeschnitte varieties include the aforesaid Polish Napoleonka or <em>krem&oacute;wka</em>, which was known to be the favorite dessert of Pope John Paul II, and Slovenian <em>kremna rezina</em>, the signature dessert of Bled; a popular Alpine resort settled on the shores of the eponymous lake.</p>",28,36.744,17.705,5.841,322.74,0.01809816,Cremeschnitte,/images/dishes/d0e8e6e561d54842a175c857a207edc9.png,cremeschnitte,48.2074098,16.38345239
Pizza marinara,"<p>Marinara is a Neapolitan pizza with a topping of tomatoes, oregano, garlic, extra virgin olive oil, and sometimes fresh basil. Its name is not derived from the popular belief that it has seafood on it (because it does not), but because it was a staple food of the fishermen who consumed it upon their return home from fishing in the Bay of Naples. Some claim it was invented at Pizzeria <em>Port'Alba</em> in 1734, considered the oldest pizzeria in the world. Marinara is a part of protected Napoletana pizzas, with specific rules concerning the production process, the dough, and the key ingredients used in making the pizza.</p>",28,57.86718889,7.777838889,13.37085,372.5212778,0.035892849,Pizza marinara,/images/dishes/b0be869e43e9447c9c06751540153e49.png,pizza-marinara,40.84004783,14.24780846
Sachertorte,"<p>The original Sachertorte is the most famous Austrian cake. It is a classic, layered chocolate sponge cake that is thinly coated with high-quality apricot jam and topped with chocolate icing. Sachertorte is said to taste the best when accompanied by a small cloud of unsweetened whipped cream on the side. It was invented in 1832 by Franz Sacher, a pastry chef for Prince Clemens Lothar Wensel Metternich, the State Chancellor of Austria at the time. The prince wanted a new cake, and Sacher, 16 years old at the time, obliged him by creating something new from ingredients that were readily available in the kitchen. Suffice to say, the cake was a huge hit, and Franz's son Eduard opened a hotel called <em>Sacher</em> in 1876, serving the popular cake up to this day. Today, almost every coffee house in Vienna has its own version of the cake, but no two cakes are quite alike. In order to avoid confusion, it is recommended to look for the official Sacher chocolate seal on top of the cake, which can only be found on the Original Sacher, produced by Hotel Sacher in a quantity of approximately 360,000 cakes per year. Interestingly, from 1954 to 1963, Hotel Sacher went through a legal battle with their rival, Demel cafe, and the court proceedings focused on which one had the right to call its Sachertorte the original. The issues that were discussed included whether the cake should have an additional layer of apricot jam in the middle, and whether to use margarine or butter. Following a long seven-year dispute, the parties have reached an agreement&mdash;and the original Sacher torte is now only found at the Hotel Sacher. Nevertheless, Demel version, which does not have the additional layer of apricot jam in the middle, is almost equally popular.</p>

Bratwurst,"<p>What was once an item for survival during the cold winter months and a technique of not wasting meat scraps is nowadays a delicacy consumed throughout Germany and abroad. Bratwurst stems from two words, an Old High German word <em>brat</em>, meaning <em>meat without waste</em>, and <em>wurst</em>, which means<em> sausage</em>. Bratwurst has origins with the Celtics, but the Franconians developed it further. It dates back to the 1300s in a region that would eventually become Eastern Germany. Bratwurst is usually consumed for breakfast, due to the tradition of farmers who would make the sausages in the morning and eat them by noon, as they would otherwise spoil. Technically, a bratwurst must be made from either pork, veal, or beef, but there are more than 40 varieties of the sausage throughout Germany. The oldest recipe for bratwurst was discovered in 2000 by a historian named Heinrich H&ouml;llerlhas. The same recipe, for the <em>Thuringian bratwurst</em> (one of the most famous varieties), says that the makers had to use only the purest, unspoiled meat in the production process. Today, bratwursts are commonly served with sauerkraut, potato salad, horseradish, or mustard in Germany, but the sausages are also popular in the United States, especially in Wisconsin, where they are commonly found at summer cookouts and barbecues.</p>",28,2.546125,20.17515,14.3031,259.6525,0.055085547,Bratwurst,/images/dishes/bcdd51a23f934cfcab7eb94c3f13320f.png,bratwurst,49.44970133,11.07997481
Khachapuri,"<p>This simple cheese bread known as khachapuri is the most famous dish in Georgia. It is traditionally topped with melted cheese, eggs and butter. There are different types of khachapuri, and even though some new cheese varieties such as mozzarella and feta have been incorporated in the dish, the most common additions still include traditional Georgian <em>Sulguni</em> or <em>Imeretian</em> cheese. It is shaped into different forms, and depending on the baking procedure and its form, it can be consumed individually or shared. Two of the most common varieties include the <em>Imeretian khachapuri</em>, shaped into a circular form, and <em>Adjaran khachapuri</em>, the open-faced version topped with butter and a raw egg on top. Although it is considered a snack, khachapuri can often be consumed as a full meal. It can also be bought at numerous kiosks located alongside Georgian roads. Khachapuri is also often prepared in Russia, in the whole area of the former Soviet Union, and throughout the world.</p>",27,47.51551667,23.84842778,20.48847222,499.5964444,0.041010044,Khachapuri,/images/dishes/f100f7a74309480ea6af64047c21ed82.png,khachapuri,41.69260122,44.80322526
Karedok,"<p>Karedok is the traditional Indonesian version of a vegetable salad. This simple and healthy dish calls for fresh and raw ingredients which are sliced and served with a traditional peanut sauce. The most common vegetables in karedok include cucumbers, cabbage, green beans, Thai basil, bean sprouts, and eggplant, however, other vegetables can be used as well. The sauce is made by grinding fried peanuts together with salt, palm sugar, and chili. The flavor of the sauce can be adjusted with other ingredients such as shrimp paste or garlic. Due to the usage of peanut sauce, karedok is often compared with another Indonesian specialty, <em>gado-gado</em>, but it is still distinguished by the usage of only raw ingredients. Karedok originated in West Java and is traditionally associated with the Sundanese ethnic group. In Indonesia, karedok can be found at food stalls, traditional hawker-style food courts, and restaurants. However, for the Sundanese community, it represents a daily dish, eaten at any time of the day, and it is usually served together with rice, tofu, tempeh and <em>krupuk -</em> traditional Asian prawn crackers.</p>",27,30,7,5,196,0.025510204,Karedok,/images/dishes/12f35a2ad81b49968e4b48590b625547.png,karedok,-6.936618511,107.6062071
Crostini,"<p>Crostini are a group of Italian appetizers consisting of small pieces of toasted or grilled bread topped with a variety of flavorful toppings. Crostini are believed to have originated during the Middle Ages, when poor Italian peasants used to eat their food off of bread instead of plates. The bread was often stale, so it had to be soaked in a liquid such as wine to make it edible. Today, crostini are topped with virtually anything from olive oil, fresh herbs, and garlic to cheeses, olives, spinach, and tomatoes. They can be served as bar snacks, appetizers, or in soups, and in some cases, crostini can be served as a side dish with steak tartare.</p>",27,28.56229444,7.889688889,4.597105556,206.8511111,0.022224225,Crostini,/Images/Dishes/eb3c0bde6d97483893f14c22781da77c.png,crostini,41.89249155,12.48469006
Guly??s,"<p>This Hungarian specialty is prepared with meat, traditionally beef, that is simmered in a rich paprika-infused broth, usually alongside onions, bell peppers, root vegetables, various spices, and occasionally tomatoes. Guly&aacute;s is a well-known dish that enjoys immense popularity even outside the Hungarian borders. In many countries, the word is synonymous with a thick stew, while in Hungary guly&aacute;s mostly represents a soup-like dish. It closely resembles <em>p&ouml;rk&ouml;lt</em>&mdash;a thick Hungarian stew consisting of meat, onions, and selected spices&mdash;which is what most people outside of Hungary associate with the word guly&aacute;s (<em>goulash)</em>. They both originated as traditional, rustic dishes that appeared in their modern-day form in the 18th century when paprika became a commonly used spice. In Hungary, guly&aacute;s is traditionally served accompanied by <em>csipetke</em> pasta or bread and is mainly enjoyed as a hearty main course.</p>",27,14.40111111,11.35888889,14.74111111,242.2222222,0.060857798,Guly??s,/images/dishes/66b7cdb0e8534f5c8259a0434db1393a.png,gulyas,47.49759811,19.04729091
Sunday Roast,"<p>Possibly the most famous of all English dishes alongside fish and chips, Sunday roast is traditionally made for the big family meal of the week, Sunday lunch. Depending on the area, some carve the meat in thin slices in the kitchen and bring it to the table, while others carve it on the family table so that everyone can enjoy the view. Although beef is the most traditional option, lamb, duck, goose, pork, or turkey are also often used for Sunday roast. The meat is almost always accompanied by roasted potatoes, fresh seasonal vegetables such as broccoli, cabbage and parsley, carrots with coriander, and a thick, rich gravy. As a side dish, Yorkshire puddings are served on the same plate, baked beneath the meat, oozing with juicy meat drippings. Sunday roast is not just a dish of the week, but also a philosophy, representing family, friends, love, friendship and sharing.</p>",27,48.08461538,22.16153846,43.69230769,579.0769231,0.075451647,Sunday Roast,/Images/Dishes/a0f80aad6cdc42c88999aad355a1edfa.png,sunday-roast-beef,51.50684993,-0.126868303
Chinese Mitten Crab,"<p>Easily identifiable by the patches of scruffy dark hair on its claws, the succulent, moist, and meaty Shanghai hairy crab is a delicacy that is large as an adult person's palm. Its flesh is firm, yet tender and delicate, so it is always steamed whole, without any seasonings, while the meat is much sweeter than regular crabmeat. When consumed, it is typically dipped into a combination of rice vinegar and soy sauce, then topped with sliced ginger. These crabs are traditionally eaten hot, and two to four crabs per person usually makes a satisfying meal. Hairy crabs are in season from September until mid-November, a time of the year when the city's neighbourhoods are interspersed with markets and high-end restaurants offering this delicacy. The Chinese people believe that hairy crab has a cooling (<em>yin</em>) effect on the body, so it should be paired with suitable warming foods and beverages such as the potent yellow rice wine.</p>",27,7.048125,4.994375,6.960625,100.1125,0.069528031,Chinese Mitten Crab,/images/dishes/9cb9110c33d34b03b6ac18ca168c08c1.png,shanghai-hairy-crab,31.21645214,121.4365049
Ketupat,"<p><em>Ketupat</em> are unique Asian rice cakes, prepared and sold in traditional woven containers made out of palm, coconut, or pandan leaves. Although they appear in numerous shapes and sizes, the most common variety is the cube-shaped ketupat, resembling a tiny woven basket. When the pouch is completed, the rice is securely sealed inside, and the whole packet is usually boiled in water, or occasionally in a mixture of coconut milk and water. After they have been boiled, the cakes need to be chilled, and because of their distinct texture they can easily be cut into slices. Ketupat can be found in many Asian countries, but its origin is usually associated with the Indonesian island of Java. Ketupat is particularly important during the Eid festival in the Muslim community. It also holds a strong religious symbolism, according to which the intricately woven leaves represent the mistakes caused by human nature, and the white rice inside stands for innocence, purity, and the final deliverance of sins. Sliced ketupat is usually served alongside famous Indonesian <em>rendang</em>, different curry varieties, sliced cucumbers, or it can simply be topped with a delectable peanut sauce.</p>",27,43.27176471,7.671176471,4.563529412,207.5235294,0.021990419,Ketupat,/images/dishes/b3e2956536f84e23a7daa3ac5abdaf71.png,ketupat,-6.176236257,106.8316838
F??ngl??s??,"<p>F&egrave;ngl&iacute;s?? are Taiwanese pineapple cakes, one of the country's most popular desserts and souvenirs.

Mandi,"<p><em>Mandi</em> is Yemen's national dish, native to Hadhramaut province, consisting of lamb or chicken meat, fragrant basmati rice and a mixture of various spices. If lamb is used in the dish, it should be small-sized and as young as possible, to further enhance the flavors. To make Mandi, the meat should be cooked in the <em>tandoor</em>, a specially designed hole in the ground covered with clay and charcoal, acting as an oven for the suspended meat above it. It is then closed and no smoke is allowed to go outside as it flavors the meat instead. When the meat is tender and juicy, it is served with rice and accompaniments such as salads, yogurt, and spicy tomato chutneys. Beloved in Yemen and the rest of the Arabian Peninsula, mandi is often served for special events, such as feasts and weddings.</p>",27,54.94845,9.313,17.1485,330.15,0.051941542,Mandi,/Images/Dishes/dd918aa4d8c147cfab7eb0a926855fa6.png,mandi,14.54530609,49.12332763
Tsukemono,"<p>Thinly sliced Japanese pickles collectively called tsukemono (lit. pickled things) are an indispensable part of almost every <em>washoku</em>, a traditional Japanese meal. Tsukemono can be served as an accompaniment or garnish for meals, but it can also be served with rice as an <em>okazu</em> (side dish), with drinks as an <em>otsumami</em> (snack), or even as a part of <em>chanoyu</em>, the Japanese tea ceremony. These pickles of various colors and shapes are made from many different preserved fruits and vegetables; the most popular include daikon radish, aubergine, cucumbers, sour plums, turnips, carrots, gobo root, nappa cabbage, ginger, and shiso buds. Even though they can easily be prepared at home, Japanese pickles are available for purchase in most Asian grocery stores, and depending on the type of preservation, tsukemono comes in countless varieties and regional specialties. Some of the most popular are salt-pickled <em>shiozuke</em>, the simplest and easiest tsukemono to prepare; <em>suzuke</em> pickles brined in Japanese rice vinegar; the sweet and salty <em>shoyuzuke</em> tsukemono pickled in soy sauce which is usually combined with vinegar and sugar; and <em>misozuke</em> pickles cultured in miso paste seasoned with mirin, garlic, and ginger. There is also <em>fukujinzuke</em>, a crunchy chutney-like seven pickle relish cured in soy sauce that is commonly served as a garnish for Japanese curry; and <em>nukazuke</em>, one of the most complicated tsukemono pickled in rice bran - the hard outer layers of rice which are roasted and mixed with salt, kombu seaweed, and water to make a mash called <em>nukamiso</em> or <em>nukadoko</em>. Apart from providing nutritional and health benefits of lactic-acid fermentation, the tangy bits of tsukemono serve an important purpose of cleansing the palate during a meal, lend refreshing tartness to counter the heaviness of umami-rich foods, and bring color, texture, and fragrance to a meal, which is why tsukemono is sometimes also called <em>konomono</em> (lit. fragrant things).</p>",27,8.455625,0.93875,2.424375,55.12125,0.043982584,Tsukemono,/Images/Dishes/70d8a3f8fcd3479eb26d1873088af646.png,tsukemono,35.68094497,139.7597404
Pierogi,"<p>These stuffed dumplings derived their name from the Russian word for pie: <em>pirog</em>. This former peasant food evolved into one of Poland's favorite dishes. Every family has their own version of pierogi filling, and the ingredients that can be used are limited only by the imagination of the chef. Pierogies can be sweet, savory, or spicy, and the most common fillings include cheese, onions, ground meat, mushrooms, potatoes, and sauerkraut. The sweet versions commonly include various berries, such as strawberries or blueberries. Traditionally, these dumplings are served as the 12th course of a traditional Polish Christmas Eve dinner. As the entire meal must be meatless, the filling usually consists of mushrooms, cabbage, and sauerkraut. Although pierogies have been made since the 13th century, it is not known where they were originally created&mdash;the Poles, Romanians, Russians, Ukrainians, Lithuanians, and Slovaks all claim they should be credited as the inventors of the pierogi. Others claim that it was brought to the West by the Tatars, and some say that the original pierogi traveled from China and reached Europe through Italy. Despite all this uncertainty, one fact is indisputable&mdash;the word <em>pierogi </em>first appeared in print in the second half of the 17th century. Today, pierogies are extremely popular throughout the country, and can be found in numerous <em>pierogarnia</em> eateries on Polish street corners. Poland also celebrates National Pierogi Day every year on October 8th, while the city of Krak&oacute;w boasts its own annual Pierogi Festival held on August 17th.</p>",27,29.725,6.205,7.795,220.7,0.035319438,Pierogi,/images/dishes/4d7e2cf629e0474497e2bc9b76e0b561.png,pierogi,52.23008251,21.0090784
Croque-monsieur,"<p>According to Larousse, this classic French hot sandwich consists of a thin slice of ham and melted cheese tucked between two pieces of sliced bread. The original first appeared on Parisian menus in 1910, and some claim it was invented by accident, when French workers left their lunch near a hot radiator, only to come back later and discover that the cheese in their sandwiches had melted. If you want to taste an authentic croque, the cheese must be Gruyere (mixed with bechamel in order to get Mornay sauce) and the whole sandwich needs to be saut&eacute;ed in butter until it is crispy and golden brown. The croque-monsieur is so popular that the famous novelist Proust even wrote about it in his 1918 masterpiece <em>In Search of Lost Time</em>. According to food historians, the sandwich was originally named by Michel Lunarca, the owner of a popular bistro on the Boulevard des Capucines in the early 20th-century Paris. Frustrated by his success, Lunarca's competitors began spreading rumors that he was a cannibal. When he ran out of baguettes for sandwiches one day, he used a loaf of <em>pain de mie</em> to make a toasted sandwich with cheese and bread. Upon being asked by a guest what kind of meat he used for the sandwich, he replied ""Le viande de monsieur, &eacute;videmment.""&mdash;meaning&mdash;""Human meat, obviously."" The joke made these sandwiches an instant hit, and he put them on the menu under the name they are known by today. For those who think everything tastes better with eggs, there is the <em>croque-madame</em>, a popular version of croque-monsieur topped with a fried egg, which, according to some people, represents a woman's hat.</p>",27,36.29321111,14.87725556,16.38637222,391.2570556,0.041881346,Croque-monsieur,/Images/Dishes/1909dda580ca44088cb2e4aefef5239f.png,croque-monsieur,48.86643715,2.334293036
Champon,"<p>Champon is a Japanese noodle dish and a Nagasaki specialty made by frying pork, seafood, and various vegetables in lard, then adding a chicken-pork bone soup and boiling the noodles in the combination. The dish is based on Chinese cooking and takes its inspiration from a dish originating from the Chinese province of Fujian. Its name, champon, comes from the Fujian word <em>shapon</em>, meaning <em>to eat a meal</em>. It was originally served in Nagasaki as an inexpensive, filling meal for the students of the city. The first version of the dish was a combination of pork and bamboo shoots, but eventually came to include ingredients such as squid, oysters, and shrimp.</p>",27,54.749175,10.11158,15.67657,374.6708,0.041840917,Champon,/images/dishes/fd36e0ecc06c41efb07bcfd1598e9439.png,champon,32.76498801,129.885033
Zhajiangmian,"<p>Zhajiangmian is a Beijing specialty consisting of wheat noodles in soybean sauce and vegetables such as summer radish and sliced cucumbers. The sauce is usually made by cooking ground pork or beef in combination with fermented soybean paste. There is also a vegetarian version of the dish that substitutes the meat with smoked tofu in the production of the sauce. Although the dish is native to China, it was embraced by the Koreans 100 years ago, when it was introduced to them by Shandong immigrants. In Korea, the dish is known as <em>ja jang myun</em>, and it is extremely popular because it is cheap, convenient, and casual. It has become so commercialized in Korea that it can even be bought in an instant ramen package.</p>",27,21.28,6.18,6.3,163,0.038650307,Zhajiangmian,/Images/Dishes/8c924898a41c4bc09fe64c1221ce4188.png,zhajiangmian,39.92904801,116.3890539
Profiterole,"<p>These chocolate-covered puff pastries are filled with either whipped cream, custard, pastry cream, or vanilla ice cream. Many theories exist about the origin of this dessert, but the most likely one traces it back to the 13th century, when the chefs who first created the puff pastry in France and southern Germany began filling them with savory cheese mixtures and herbs. Sweet versions of the dish followed, and by the 17th century, the small pastries were referred to as choux (lit. cabbage), because the pastries were visually reminiscent of heads of cabbage. By the mid-19th century, the puffs had become known as profiteroles in France and England &ndash; they were decorated to resemble swans or pyramids, and were often served with dessert wine, tea, or coffee. Regardless of the pastry&rsquo;s murky origins, one bite will be more than enough to answer your only real question &ndash; yes, they&rsquo;re delicious.</p>",27,22.79152353,12.50809412,7.703135294,239.36,0.032182216,Profiterole,/images/dishes/39c7b477845a4c5bafdff08bf67501bd.png,profiterole,48.85703523,2.349014282
Tempura,"<p>Although tempura is battered and deep-fried, the Japanese approach to food, characterized by clean flavors, simplicity, and minimalistic approach to ingredients remains intact. The most favorable ingredients for the dish include shrimp, scallops, squid, and small crabs, or vegetables such as shiitake mushrooms, asparagus, Japanese eggplant, and snow peas. The batter is the most crucial part of tempura, consisting of flour, eggs, and water, keeping the ingredients moist and flavorful. Even though the dish is very simple, it has quite murky origins. The most popular theory says that the Jesuit missionaries who came to Japan from Portugal in the 16th century were the most probable inspiration for the dish, consuming vegetable and seafood fritters on <em>ember days</em> (days on which no meat was allowed to be consumed). Another theory says that battered and deep-fried food was introduced to Japan by the Chinese, initially embraced by Zen priests who wanted to make their vegetarian diet more flavorful. Regardless of the origins of tempura, it remains an iconic dish that is served in a wide variety of ways: on its own, over rice, accompanied by <em>tentsuyu</em> or soy sauce, or even as a filling in sushi rolls.</p>",27,18.6462875,7.8233125,4.2830625,162.209575,0.026404499,Tempura,/Images/Dishes/4800298f207649c796be99a3861139ed.png,tempura,35.68362107,139.7605627
Lokum,"<p>Lokum are succulent, sugary cubes from Turkey based on a gel of starch and sugar. Traditionally, lokum is flavored with rose water, lemon, bergamot orange, mastic, or mint, but the Turkish favorite remains a lokum of plain jelly combined with pistachios. There are also other varieties, using ingredients such as cinnamon, dates, hazelnuts, or walnuts. These cubes are typically offered with tea and coffee after breakfast, lunch, and dinner in most Turkish homes. The sweet treats were invented by Bekir Affendi, who came to Istanbul in 1777 from Anatolia. His first shop,<em> Haci Bekir</em>, is still in business, run by his descendants. The name of these sweets comes from the Arabic term<em> rahat-ul hulkum,</em> meaning <em>heal</em> or <em>soothe the throat</em>. Its other popular name, <em>Turkish delight,</em> was coined in the 18th century when an English traveler took some of the sweets back home, and since he couldn't pronounce the Arabic name, he coined his own term. The original recipe called for corn flour, refined beet sugar, honey, and water. The treat soon gained popularity, and today it is one of the most famous symbols of Turkey.</p>",27,58.77157895,15.58373684,3.592105263,366.2126316,0.009808797,Lokum,/Images/Dishes/0f8281fc6ed14546bbc6cafc9d64a86c.png,lokum,41.00917674,28.96407951
Carnitas,"<p>Originating from the Mexican state of Michoac&aacute;n, carnitas is a flavorful dish made from pork (usually front sections or pork shoulder) that is braised, roasted, or slow-cooked in its own fat for a long time until fully tender and succulent. The heat is then turned up until the meat is crispy on the exterior and can be shredded. Carnitas, which translates to <em>little meats</em>, is often served with tortillas, accompanied by salsas, beans, guacamole, lime, or fresh vegetables. In Michoac&aacute;n, carnitas are found everywhere from street stalls to upscale restaurants, although the dish is more often made for special occasions such as Christmas, anniversaries, or birthdays. Tender, fresh, and tasty, carnitas are a special treat for meat lovers worldwide.</p>",26,12.67560526,15.86197895,22.63314737,292.0733684,0.077491308,Carnitas,/images/dishes/4def1d8a069248e784f7f3c9a5d9a32c.png,carnitas,19.70268091,-101.1924709
Banana Split,"<p>Banana split is a classic dessert consisting of a lengthwise-cut banana topped with scoops of strawberry, vanilla, and chocolate ice cream. Typical garnishes include nuts, fruits, whipped cream, and a cherry on top. The dessert is traditionally served in a long dish called a <em>boat</em>. It was invented in 1904 in Latrobe, Pennsylvania by David Strickler, who wanted to make something ""different"" for a college student who had one day entered the pharmacy where he worked as an apprentice. The pharmacies often featured a soda fountain where customers could indulge in a soda or a frozen treat for just a few cents. Banana split has remained popular ever since, and there is even the annual <em>Great American Banana Split Festival</em> held in Latrobe, where the original soda fountain is still kept.</p>",26,51.73566667,13.80410556,5.362783333,348.9350556,0.015369001,Banana Split,/Images/Dishes/05bc453310ff487793b42c090d0515ab.png,banana-split,40.32120792,-79.37948364
Braai,"<p>Braai is a South African term for barbecue, and it can be both a noun and a verb &ndash; you can <em>braai</em> a sausage or a steak, but you can also throw <em>a braai</em> with friends. There is no real braai without the fire, and it isn't considered a braai if the meat is cooked on a gas grill. The selection of meat typically includes steaks, boerewors sausages, kebabs, sosaties, and marinated pork, chicken, or lamb chops, while fish and crayfish are more popular in the coastal regions. Once done, the meat is traditionally accompanied by pap or krummelpap, salads, and vegetables, if desired. The person in charge of the grilling is known as the <em>braaier</em>, and he usually sits around the fire with other men, while women are in charge for the preparation of various side dishes.</p>",26,21.67631579,17.58052632,16.02315789,214.4754316,0.074708594,Braai,/images/dishes/815695b971eb4bb89a6aae9079574cbf.png,braai,-33.92912197,18.41731595
Feijoada ?? portuguesa,"<p>Feijoada is a hearty bean stew that appears in several local and international varieties. Although it is often assumed that feijoada originated in Brazil, where it is considered a national dish, it was primarily made in Portugal before it was introduced to Brazil. The Portuguese version is believed to have originated in the north of Portugal, but today it appears in several versions throughout the country. It is usually made with red kidney or white beans, while the additions usually include pork, beef, blood sausage (<em>morcela</em>), farinheira sausage, or chouri&ccedil;o. Some variations also include vegetables. Similar versions of feijoada are found in most Portuguese colonies, including Brazil, Macau, Angola, Mozambique.</p>",26,18.19166667,15.775,20.045,379.7777778,0.052780866,Feijoada ?? portuguesa,/images/dishes/8217108c4be0447d82abb4829854d3b4.png,feijoada-a-portuguesa,38.70811041,-9.137227109
Hakata ramen,"<p>Hailing from Fukuoka, hakata is one of the most famous ramen styles in Japan. The base of the ramen is <em>tonkotsu</em>, the creamy pork bone broth which gives the dish its incredibly rich and layered taste. It is often only seasoned with <em>shio</em> (salt), and occasionally with <em>shoyu</em> (soy sauce) and <em>miso</em> (fermented soybean) paste. Hakata ramen is typically served with ultra-thin, straight, and firm wheat noodles, though it&rsquo;s possible to choose the firmness of the noodles according to individual preferences. Although thin slices of <em>chashu</em> pork and chopped green onions are the most common, other typical additions to the broth include spicy mustard greens, ramen eggs, wood ear mushrooms, <em>beni sh??ga</em> (pickled ginger root), garlic, bean sprouts, <em>mayu</em>, and crushed sesame seeds. This ramen style derives its name from the former port city and merchant quarter of Hakata, which, in 1889, was merged with the castle town of Fukuoka into one city that came to be known as Fukuoka city.</p>",26,54.675,10.4615,12.601,375.3,0.033575806,Hakata ramen,/images/dishes/4874ee91bc9c47c9879bda773c7c5aeb.png,hakata-ramen,33.59501502,130.410014
Lechon,"<p>Lechon, derived from a Spanish word for <em>roasted suckling pig</em> is one of the most popular dishes in the Philippines. The slowly-roasted suckling pig is usually stuffed with lemongrass, tamarind, garlic, onions, and chives, and is then roasted on a large bamboo spit over an open fire. It is traditionally served whole on a platter, at celebrations and festive events such as weddings and Christmas. Once the meat is properly roasted and falls off the bone, people tend to eat every part of the pig, and the crispy, reddish-brown, crackling skin is especially beloved. Lechon is often served with a thick and rich liver sauce that is cooked with sugar, fresh herbs, and vinegar. If anything is left after the feast, the leftovers are often made into <em>lechon slaw</em>, slowly cooked with vinegar, garlic, and liver sauce for that extra bit of flavor. Apart from the Philippines, the dish is especially popular in countries such as Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Spain. Some famous chefs even named lechon the best pig in the world, so it is definitely worth a try.</p>",26,3.826315789,14.40052632,16.97263158,228.5263158,0.074269922,Lechon,/Images/Dishes/cec794bba03943df88450f85e20d4d4e.png,lechon,14.59045019,120.982668
Tur??u,"<p>Tur??u is the common name for a variety of Turkish pickled vegetables of all shapes, sizes, and colors, including eggplant, zucchini, onions, carrots, cucumber, beets, garlic, and grape leaves. The vegetables are placed in a jar with vinegar and brine, then stored for a few months. The tradition of pickling dates back thousands of years, when fresh vegetables were preserved over the year for consumption in the winter months. Tur??u is often served as an appetizer, while <em>tur??u suyu&ndash;</em>the flavorful pickle juice&ndash;is often served as a refreshment on hot summer days.</p>",26,7.79,0.215263158,0.871578947,36.13157895,0.02412236,Tur??u,/images/dishes/dad8da9da53d4aa5aabfaf28473596ad.png,tursu,39.92148779,32.85658603
Peking Duck,"<p>The history of Peking duck goes back to China's Yuan Dynasty of the 13th century. <em>Bianyifang</em>, Beijing's oldest restaurant specializing in Peking duck has been in business since the Jiajing reign of the 16th century, serving as a testament to the popularity of this succulent, tantalizing dish. The duck is cooked until the skin turns golden and crispy and the meat becomes tender, slightly sweet, and moist. Both the meat and the skin are then folded in thin pancakes or steamed white buns. To make an authentic Beijing kao ya, the duck must be a white feathered Imperial Peking duck, hung for 24 hours, and pumped with air through a small puncture between the breasts and wings. It is usually brushed with a mixture of ginger, oil, hoisin sauce, honey, and rice vinegar, then vertically hung and slowly roasted to perfection. When the dish is served, the skin will often come first as an appetizer, followed by the meat which is accompanied by cucumbers, scallions, hoisin sauce, buns, and pancakes. With its 400-year history, exquisite flavors, and elaborate preparation, it comes as no surprise that Peking duck is one of the most famous Chinese dishes.</p>",26,41.11592,18.618735,23.698605,424.32495,0.055850133,Peking Duck,/images/dishes/121e23f2204c43d39262d127d691e619.png,peking-duck,39.92787599,116.387109
Sauerkraut,"<p>Although sauerkraut or sour fermented cabbage is a German invention, it has origins in China, when it was made from shredded cabbage that was fermented in rice wine. Some claim that it was brought to Europe by Genghis Khan after his plunders in China. In Germany, they use salt instead of wine, so the water is drawn out from the cabbage, making a juice that accompanies it in the process. Fermented cabbage is often used as a side dish accompanying numerous meat dishes, but it is also often found in casseroles and sandwiches. Sauerkraut is also praised as being an excellent source of vitamins, along with being a flavorful comfort food consumed throughout Eastern Europe and abroad.</p>",26,3.204084211,0.186252632,0.810115789,21.19043158,0.038230264,Sauerkraut,/Images/Dishes/f3dc3460fdb04db5a7b01816b74b3165.png,sauerkraut,52.52070105,13.39534347
Okoshi,"<p>Kaminari-okoshi, often called merely <em>okoshi</em>, is a popular Japanese confectionery, similar to rice crispy treats. The main ingredient in okoshi is expanded rice, created by roasting rice grains until they pop. A mix of sugar and butter or corn syrup is used to hold the rice together, and after the additional ingredients have been added, the mixture is formed or pressed in trays, left to dry, then cut into square shapes. This crispy Japanese treat first appeared during the mid-Edo period in Japan and was primarily sold by street vendors in the vicinity of Buddhist temples in Asakusa, one of the districts in Tokyo. Originally, peanuts were added to enrich okoshi, but modern versions also include other nuts, dried fruit, chocolate, or sesame seeds, along with other exotic and interesting flavors such as matcha green tea or caramel. Most okoshi is nowadays factory-produced, created in an array of unusual flavor and color combinations, and sold in decorative, colorful boxes. In the Asakusa area, there are still traditional street vendors who prepare this brittle snack and demonstrate the entire procedure. Okoshi is still the most famous souvenir of the Asakusa area.</p>",26,18.0725,1.57,1.3053,93.55,0.013952966,Okoshi,/Images/Dishes/9aaaa3d2aaf34c46831ce17f40095661.png,okoshi,35.68501701,139.751407
Monaka,"<p>Monaka is a type of <em>wagashi</em> (traditional Japanese sweets) consisting of an azuki bean jam filling that is sandwiched between two thin mochi wafers. The wafers are crispy, dry, and neutral in flavor, coming in various shapes, colors, and sizes. Traditionally, monaka are filled with azuki bean jam, but they can also be filled with ice cream, whipped cream, cream cheese, or chestnut paste.

Picanha,"<p>Picanha is a fresh cut of beef that's especially popular and highly prized in Brazil. In the US, it's called <em>sirloin cap</em>, and in the UK, it's known as the <em>rump cap</em>. Picanha is situated on the back side of the animal, above the butt, where it sits on a fat cap. It's mostly used for churrasco &ndash; the meat is first grilled, then sliced off of a skewer. This cut holds very little fat in the meat, so it must be cooked perfectly in order not to make it tough. In Brazil, every churrasco has picanha, and all of the best churrascarias feature picanha on their menus. The name <em>picanha</em> is derived from the word <em>picana</em>, referring to the <em>ranchers' pole</em> used for herding cattle in Portugal and Spain. The technique was brought over to Brazil where the word picanha was used to refer to the part of the cow that was poked by ranchers with the pole.</p>",26,3.811,15.3995,25.1395,270.5,0.092937153,Picanha,/images/dishes/e5429c72d60744c29e106b7b9cd585d8.png,picanha,-15.79342766,-47.88320448
Couscous (dish),"<p>Numerous tiny, light, tender grains, ideally arranged to form a pyramid and served on a platter at the end of a meal - that is couscous, the national dish of Morocco and a must-have dish in any Moroccan restaurant. The word itself refers both to the complete dish and the tiny grains of semolina. Semolina flour is sprinkled with water until it forms into tiny pellets that are then pushed through a sieve. Couscous is usually prepared on Fridays for lunch, when whole families get together for the most important meal of the week. The dish is traditionally made in a metal steamer pot called a <em>couscoussier</em>, where the stew is on the bottom, while the small grains are in the perforated basket on top, cooking in the steam that is rising from the rich stew. Although couscous dishes are often full of vegetables, they are rarely vegetarian. Some classics include <em>couscous with seven vegetables</em> and <em>couscous with raisins and caramelized onions</em>, but there are many more varieties such as <em>spicy</em> with chili peppers, <em>sweet</em> with chickpeas, lamb and raisins, <em>Berber-style</em> with chicken, milk and turnips, or <em>fish couscous</em> with fish, fennel stalks, and wild turnips. There is even a dessert couscous dish served with butter and enhanced with cinnamon and sugar. After couscous is served, it is covered with meat or fish and vegetables, while the broth from the same stew is served on the side, for the ones who want to ladle some on top of the grains. However, don't be mistaken - it is not the main course, as it is served at the end of a long string of courses to totally satiate the consumer, as the popular Arabian hospitality saying goes - ""No guest should go home hungry"".</p>",26,42.78,4.98,11.245,272.76195,0.041226425,Couscous (dish),/Images/Dishes/dc1a28bc96284a3481aefa7710c749d1.png,Moroccan-Couscous,34.01840103,-6.828352355
Beef Stroganoff,"<p>When it first appeared in the mid-19th-century Russia, beef Stroganoff was a dish made out of lightly floured beef cubes that have been saut&eacute;ed and cooked in a simple sauce made from stock and mustard with only a small amount of sour cream. The origin of the dish is unclear, but it is most likely linked to a French chef&mdash;or a French-trained chef&mdash;working for the Stroganoff family. Although Russian in origin, the dish is strongly influenced by the French style of cooking&mdash;this is most obviously seen in the way the beef is cut, in either cubes or strips. The first known recipe appeared in Elena Molokhovets&rsquo;s <em>A Gift to Young Housewives,</em> published in 1871. Since then, the dish has had major alterations. The beef is still cut in strips, but the sauce is much richer; with sliced mushrooms and onions that are cooked with beef stock and thickened a bit with sour cream that is only stirred in at the end. The dish is traditionally served with potato straws, but goes equally well with either rice pilav, egg noodles, or mashed potatoes.</p>",26,20.30272,17.067625,23.335415,340.401295,0.068552662,Beef Stroganoff,/Images/Dishes/804ff21692d04103b16a155e8fee26e3.png,beef-stroganoff,55.7506538,37.61844385

Amatriciana,"<p>Named after Amatrice, a provincial town in the Sabine Hills northeast of Rome; the iconic Amatriciana sauce is often considered a part of the ""holy trinity of Roman pasta"", together with carbonara and cacio e pepe. Amatriciana was invented in the 17th century by adding tomatoes to the already famous <em>gricia</em> sauce &ndash; diced tomatoes are saut&eacute;ed in fat rendered from juicy bits of guanciale (cured pork jowl), then tossed together with grated pecorino cheese and either spaghetti or bucatini pasta. The first recipe for Amatriciana was published in the 1790 cookbook<em> L&rsquo;Apicio Moderno</em> by Francesco Leonardi, a renowned Roman chef and author. Over time, this classic Italian dish became so popular it was featured in several movies, from Alberto Sordi&rsquo;s 1954 film <em>An American in Rome</em> and Luciano Salce&rsquo;s 1978 <em>Where Are You Going on Holiday?</em> to Ryan Murphy&rsquo;s <em>Eat Pray Love</em>, in which Julia Roberts joyfully wolfs down a portion of spaghetti all&rsquo;Amatriciana while sitting on the terrace of a typical Roman <em>osteria</em>. With delicate heat from pepperoncino peppers, the sweetness and tartness from the tomato-based sauce, the sharpness of pecorino, and the fatty richness of guanciale, Amatriciana is best enjoyed with medium-bodied, smooth Italian reds such as Montepulciano d&rsquo;Abruzzo and Sangiovese.</p>",26,30.68,12.835,10.9,280.6,0.038845331,Amatriciana,/images/dishes/01ff6058338b49df9b68909c2c972b9f.png,amatriciana,42.62923671,13.28917549
Steak au poivre,"<p>Steak au poivre is a French dish consisting of a beef steak that is coated in crushed peppercorns and fried. It is served with a sauce that is made in the same pan that the steak was cooked in. Typically, the dish is accompanied by potatoes and a salad on the side. According to Francis Marie, a famous steak specialist, the dish originated in the 19th century in Normandy's bistros, where men took women for late dinners of steak au poivre, due to the pepper's purported aphrodisiac properties. Numerous chefs claimed the invention of the dish, the most famous of them being &Eacute;mile Lerch, the owner of <em>Restaurant Albert</em> on the Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es, who stated that he first made the dish in 1930. Regardless of the inventor, steak au poivre remains a staple of typical French cuisine.</p>",26,8.370247368,35.91555263,31.56707895,343.8129474,0.091814689,Steak au poivre,/images/dishes/84873be64e7d41ab8f2e7819955ccb82.png,steak-au-poivre,48.85771289,2.350995217
Lebkuchen,"<p>This traditional German treat is mainly associated with Christmas and winter holidays. The term <em>lebkuchen</em> covers a wide variety of different types of honey or ginger-flavored cookies which are traditionally baked on <em>oblaten</em> (thin wafers), and glazed or coated with either dark chocolate or sugar icing. Additional ingredients may include various spices like cloves, aniseed, nutmeg, coriander, and cardamom, with different types of nuts or candied fruit. Best-known varieties of this cookie include the heart-shaped <em>lebkuchenherzen</em> which are often decorated with icing and different inscriptions, the German version of the gingerbread man called <em>honigkuchenpferd</em> (lit. honey cake horse), and <em>hexenhausel</em> (lit. witch&rsquo;s house), while the most famous is the <em>Nurnberger Elisenlebkuchen</em>. In Germany, the earliest records date back to the year 1296 and the city of Ulm, and the year 1395 and the city of Nurnberg. The area itself was an intersection of many trade routes that supplied it with spices necessary and thus helped to keep the production of lebkuchen alive and thriving. In 1996, the Nurnberger lebkuchen was granted the protected designation of origin (PDO) status which applies to all the lebkuchen produced in the city of Nurnberg.</p>",26,30.79092632,4.952731579,3.293078947,191.8900053,0.017161284,Lebkuchen,/images/dishes/636be45258124b50af28f25d02497c2b.png,lebkuchen,52.51777854,13.39423899
Ciabatta,"<p>Literally translated to <em>a slipper</em>, as a reference to its shape, ciabatta is an Italian type of white bread made with yeast and wheat flour. It is characterized by numerous air pockets on the interior and a crispy crust. The first ciabatta was made in 1982 by a Veronese miller and baker named Arnaldo Cavallari. The bread was invented as a response to the rising popularity of French baguette, as the bakers were worried that it might endanger their business. Ciabatta is considered an ideal choice for sandwiches because the crumb absorbs liquids very well. Today, many regions in Italy have their own variations of the original recipe, producing ciabattas with olive oil, whole wheat flour, marjoram, and milk.</p>",26,107.6589579,8.664857895,17.89597368,221.6557895,0.080737678,Ciabatta,/Images/Dishes/9cfdd4e7c807406c8a14dcc31a44e7a8.png,ciabatta,45.44041705,10.9901315
Caprese Pizza,"<p>This is a variety of Italian pizza that is traditionally topped with cherry tomatoes, mozzarella di bufala, olive oil, and fresh basil leaves.

??evapi,"<p>Despite their clear Turkish provenance, Bosnian ??evapi are a source of great national pride and the country's favorite dish. These tiny, hand-rolled minced meat sausages are commonly made with ground beef - or a mix of beef mince with other meats such as pork, veal or lamb - seasoned with a mix of different spices; usually garlic, salt, black pepper, and sometimes paprika or hot red pepper flakes. After they have mellowed for a couple of hours, ??evapi are barbecued over charcoal. Traditionally, one portion of the dish consists of ten pieces of ??evapi tucked in a soft, moist, slightly grilled flatbread called <em>lepinja </em>or <em>somun</em>, and a variety of accompaniments such as <em>kajmak</em>, a type of clotted cream spread, roasted red pepper and eggplant relish called <em>ajvar </em>(especially popular in Croatia and Serbia), and raw onions.</p>

English Breakfast,"<p>Also known as the <em>full breakfast</em>, this traditional British dish appears everywhere with a few essentials and some regional additions. First, there is the meat &ndash; usually a combination of sausages and bacon. The sausage is plain pork sausage, while the bacon can be streaky or back bacon. Then there are vegetables and legumes &ndash; baked beans and tomatoes, both cooked over high heat. The balance of sweetness and acidity in the tomatoes nicely balances out the fattiness on the other side of the plate. Lastly, there is a crispy piece of fried bread and two or three over-easy eggs to tie the whole meal together. Alongside this hearty breakfast, you will usually find a cup of tea, ketchup or brown sauce, and a nice fruit jam. Optionally, black pudding, kidneys, mushrooms, and potatoes can be added to the <em>fry-up</em>, depending on personal taste and regional preferences. Although it is traditionally a breakfast dish, a full English breakfast is more than hearty enough to serve as a mid-day meal.</p>

Graham Cracker,"<p>Graham cracker is a sweet American cracker made with graham flour and usually flavored with honey or cinnamon. The crackers date back to the early 1880s, when they were made with graham flour, lard or shortening, salt, molasses, and oil. They were invented by Sylvester Graham, a Presbyterian minister who introduced them in hopes to end masturbation &ndash; he believed that a radical vegetarian diet without white flour and spices would end lustful behaviour. Nowadays, the crackers are used in the preparation of s'mores, while graham cracker crumbs are used for pies, cheesecakes, and moon pies. In the Philippines, an icebox cake known as mango float uses graham crackers, cream, and mangoes.</p>",26,23.44521579,5.247152632,2.233705263,153.9865789,0.014505844,Graham Cracker,/images/dishes/97d2fbead5194de48c69ca9383bc7c08.png,graham-cracker,38.89556722,-77.03741488
Buffalo Wings,"<p>Having nothing in common with the actual buffalo nor the American bison, Buffalo wings are actually named after the place of their origin - Buffalo, New York. There are numerous stories about the origins of these mouth-watering chicken wings, but the one that seems the most authentic says that they were first served at the <em>Anchor Bar</em> in Buffalo. In 1964, Teressa Bellissimo, the bar's owner, received a shipment of chicken wings by accident and didn't know what to do with them so she got an idea to deep-fry the wings and serve them in hot sauce with a blue cheese dressing and some thickly sliced celery sticks, so they wouldn't go to waste. The crowd loved the dish, and it soon became a staple on the bar's menu, and why wouldn't it, with crispy skin on the outside, tender meat on the inside, and a special hot sauce infused with vinegar and butter, with celery sticks and blue cheese dressing providing a perfect opportunity to cool down the hotness of the wings. Today, buffalo wings can be found in every sports bar, at barbecues, and at almost every Super Bowl party in the USA.</p>",26,7.5085,14.594,22.8275,263.2,0.086730623,Buffalo Wings,/images/dishes/c8999ffc2679432c9e0a9f34a840728a.png,buffalo-wings,42.88032769,-78.87940352
Stollen,"<p>This rich fruit bread is one of German Christmas classics. Stollen is prepared with a buttery, sweet yeast dough that is usually spiced, lemon-flavored, and enriched with various dried fruits and marzipan. Though it may appear in different forms, it is usually oblong and covered with generous amounts of melted butter and powdered sugar. Among the different varieties, Dresdner stollen is considered as the oldest and the most popular version, whose origins are traced back to the 15th century. Originally, stollen was plain and prepared only with flour, yeast, and oil, and it was only in 1490, when the Pope Innocent VIII lifted the ban on baking with butter during Advent, that the stollen started to develop into a dense and rich cake that is known today.</p>",26,41.049925,12.141605,4.250275,294.49025,0.014432651,Stollen,/images/dishes/076bbc75be784975a004c1b15ae9cb78.png,stollen,51.04926543,13.73579394
Tikka,"<p>Indian <em>tikka</em> is a dish which consists of boneless meat, mostly chicken, that is cut into smaller pieces, and marinated in yogurt and traditional Indian spices such as turmeric, cumin, coriander, cayenne pepper, chili, garlic, and ginger. The meat is roasted over charcoal in a <em>tandoor</em>, the traditional cylindrical clay oven. To remain tender and juicy, the meat is repeatedly brushed with oil or butter. Tikka is typically cooked and served on sizzlers, but the plain varieties are also common. It is often wrongly associated with <em>tandoori chicken</em>, a variety baked and served with the meat left on the bone. Indian tikka has an unknown origin, but it is believed to be an ancient dish that has existed since the discovery of the tandoor oven, which has been used in India for more than 5000 years. Legend says that emperor Babur, the founder of the Mughal dynasty, requested Punjabi chefs to serve the traditional tandoori chicken without the bones, which led to the creation of the now famous chicken tikka. It is a popular dish in Pakistan and Afghanistan, where it is usually served as a chicken tikka sizzler. Mutton and lamb variations can occasionally be found, but chicken is still the most popular ingredient. Traditional chicken tikka should not be confused with the <em>chicken tikka masala</em>, a variation of the dish with origins in the United Kingdom. In chicken tikka masala the meat is served with tomato sauce and is considered to be a British national dish. Tikka is usually accompanied by onions, chopped coriander, vegetable chutney, and lemon slices.</p>",26,16.922225,8.208125,20.30949,227.5867,0.089238475,Tikka,/Images/Dishes/85bf8f875227411e8fbf90eb76241a06.png,tikka,30.72034287,76.76459232
